 gold & On Sept 30, Merck voluntarily recalled the pain killer Vioxx, used by almost 2 million, after clinical trials for its use in colon cancer showed unacceptable rates of stroke/heart attack. Results corroborated earlier warnings that had not resulted in recalls by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a COX inhibitor, Vioxx was safer for digestive tracts, important for arthritis patients. Merck's advertising campaigns did not clearly warn about side effects. The case highlighted concerns about drug manufacturers' advertising and FDAs role in insuring safety of drugs on the market. Safety of other COX inhibitors is now a concern." \\

ILP D5 & Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx was pulled from the market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.
But some doctors say this group of drugs may work in a way that increases the risk of heart problems for some patients, and they point to this latest information as additional reason for concern.

Data from a company study found then that users had four times as many heart attacks and strokes as those who used another painkiller . But the data was not definitive, and Merck, which even critics say is one of the most responsible drug companies, repeatedly reassured the medical and financial communities that Vioxx was safe.

 And if courts determine that Merck was negligent, the company will pay a heavy price in compensation.
 It is in the insurance industry's interest, the FDA's interest and the federal government's interest--because the federal government is a major provider of health insurance--either to require drug companies to conduct such comparative tests or to set up a neutral agency to do so.

 Merck had spent \$195 million to promote Vioxx as a wonder drug for the aging baby boomers.

 The drug had been approved by the FDA in 1999 for arthritis. 
 Merck had promoted Vioxx as a way to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but the study showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
