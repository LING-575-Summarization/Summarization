\begin{abstract}
As the number of online publications continues to grow at a rapid pace, there is a pressing need for a valuable tool that can automatically generate summaries from multiple articles. Our paper explores multiple approaches to multi-document summarization. These approaches include both extractive and abstractive methods. In this paper, we choose to explore Integer Linear Programming, LexRank, and Pegasus summarization methods. We build end-to-end systems using these selected methods. Finally, we will benchmark selected methods and perform an error analysis to evaluate their effectiveness.
