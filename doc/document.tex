\section{Appendix A: Workload distribution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anna Batra set up the Github repository, turned in D1
    \item Junyin Chen got the team together and set up a communication channel
    \item Sam Briggs set up the Overleaf file and sent out a when-to-meet to schedule weekly meetings
    \item Hilly Steinmetz edited the Overleaf file to prepare it for D1.
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix B: Code repository and additional software and data used in your system}

The repository for our project can be found on Github at \href{https://github.com/LING-575-Summarization/Summarization}{github.com/LING-575-Summarization/Summarization}.

We plan to use the following software for the project: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python
    \item Anaconda (for virtual environment)
    \item NLTK (for parsing, NER, and more)
    \item spaCy (for parsing, NER, and more)
    \item Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
    \item Pytorch (for large LMs)
    \item Hugging Face's Transformer library (for auto-tokenization and find-tune trained model)
\end{itemize}
