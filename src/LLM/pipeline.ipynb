Bangladesh's project to protect the Sundarbans, part of the world's largest\", \"A November 2004 natural gas leak on Norwegian Statoil's Snorre A oil platform in the North Sea caused the shutdown of production from Snorre A and neighboring platform Vigdis, resulting in a cut in oil output of 205,000 barrels a day for Norway and costing Statoil 1.4 million Euros daily. The leak, which could have caused a catastrophic explosion, was contained 18 hours after it was reported. There was no evidence of oil leaked into the water, and there were no injuries. Statoil's request to restart operations would not be granted until an inspection by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority.\", \"The South Korean president initiated an investigation of illegal wire-tapping by NIS (the intelligence service). This produced 274 illegal recordings, and led to the arrests of a retired NIS official, who had kept an illegal tape, and the businessman to whom he gave it, who then leaked it to the media. It resulted in the resignation of the ambassador to the U.S., heard on the tape in an incriminating conversation with a Samsung executive, discussing allegedly illegal political contributions. Samsung apologized and filed a libel suit. NIS' current chief admitted his agency's earlier bugging operations. The media are being questioned.\", \"In 2005, conservationists in Sri Lanka discovered thirty-five new species of frogs but also determined that nineteen species had died out. Diminishment of other species continued, such as the harlequin frog and the golden toad in Central and South America, and the mountain yellow-legged frog in California. Part of this loss of biodiversity has been blamed on global warming's impact on the deadly chytrid fungus, which grows on frogs' skin. Other waterborne dangers encountered by frogs are the chemical DEET used in insect repellents, fluoxetine which is the active ingredient in Prozac, and carbamaze\", 'A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body. This is not always the case with other diseases suspected of being caused by dioxin. Agent Orange may have been tested in Panama prior to deployment in Vietnam, thus affecting many Panamanians and Americans. There are unconfirmed reports that it was also used in Korea. Vietnam claims one million victims of Agent orange in his country. The government will provide monthly allowances for affected citizens and their disabled children.', \"Speculation grew on who poisoned Victor Yushchenko. Suspects include Vladimir Putin or the Russian mafia hired by Putin or Ukrainian officials to keep the Ukraine within the Russian sphere. Even Yushchenko's inner circle was mentioned. The poison was firmly identified as tetra-chloro-dibanzo-dioxin, which typically takes from 3 to 14 days for symptoms to appear, raising the question when and where the poisoning actually occurred. This poison will disfigure and sicken a victim, but not kill quickly. A parliamentary commission investigation was begun, but Yushchenko refused to cooperate. He expects to\", 'Proposals to preserve the Maryland oyster include placing them on the endangered species list. However since no regional specificity is allowed for invertebrates a resulting ban would be on all oysters, everywhere. Since oysters are a natural filter against pollution, restoring their numbers would contribute to cleaning Chesapeake waters but this could take decades. Supporters of introducing the Asian oyster say they grow bigger and faster, and would add the filtering capacity needed. Such a step is irreversible, however. No decision has been made. Genetic altering of native oysters to made them disease-resistant has been proposed.', 'On 4 October 2005 there were two instances of steam arising from Mount Saint Helens, this followed next day when thousands of tourists were delighted by another burst of steam and ash but with subsequent lessening of large earthquake activity. The U.S. Geologic Survey anticipated that underground molten rock termed magma would continue to rise and announced the area should get used to living with an active volcano. However, on 6 October, that agency stated an eruption was not imminent, disappointing the thousands of tourists hoping to witness an eruption similar to the 1986 event.', 'In Amsterdam, on 2 November 2004, Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the famed artist, was killed by a Muslim extremist, in apparent retaliation for the showing on TV of Theo\\'s film \"Submission\", which depicted the spousal abuse of four Muslim women. The dual Dutch and Moroccan assailant, not further identified, who left a note attached to van Gogh, was arrested immediately after the attack. The shooting heightened already strained relations between the million Muslim minority and the normally tolerant but now threatened Dutch. Immigrant groups condemned the slaying but emphasized assimilation was difficult when feeling unwanted.', \"After a 12-week trial and 9 days of deliberation, jurors found Blake not guilty of killing his wife or of solicitating murder. Jurors didn't believe the stuntmen. Prosecutors claimed Blake feared Bakley would corrupt their daughter. M. Gerry Schwartzbach took Blake's defense after three previous counselors quit. Blake never testified. Blake gave a rambling, profane, emotional interview to reporters and cut the electronic monitor off his leg. He said he was broke and needed a job. The judge returned his passport. Blake planned to roam around and get revitalized. Fans celebrated at Vit\", \"Coral reefs provide seafood and livelihood for one billion Asians alone, many from impoverished areas. Over 58% of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, over-fishing, disease, and climate change. Reefs suffer from hurricanes and El Nino-triggered bleaching. Coral reef damage from the late December Indian Ocean tsunamis is yet to be assessed. About 30% of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down from 41% two years ago. About two-fifths of those damaged in the 1998 El Nino bleaching have since recovered. Taiwan is constructing artificial reefs to act as foundations to support new living\", \"Pfc. Lynndie England pleaded guilty to humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghad late in 2003. In hearings, England said her actions were wrong but early in the trial she contradicted that statement. Judge Col. Pohl stopped her and said he didn't want her to plead guilty unless she thought she was. Military judges cannot accept a guilty plea if the defendant doesn't accept guilt. If accepted, a military jury decides punishment and defendant gets the lesser of that or the plea agreed to by prosecutors. Defense attornies are Capt. Crisps and Rick Hernandez.\", \"Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a suicide car bomb February 14, 2005 in Beirut. Six of his body guards and 10 other were also killed with about 120 injured. Two Islamic terrorist groups claimed responsibility but opposition leaders blamed the Lebanese and Syrian governments. Hariri opposed Syrian intervention in the Lebanese presidential term and was working to make a comeback in the May election. The opposition, France, and the US called for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops. The opposition and France called for an international commission, while the opposition also demanded the Prime Minister's resignation.\", \"Britain's Food Standards Agency ordered 474 foods recalled because they contain the dye Sudan I, used to color products like oils and shoe polish. The EU has banned its use in foods because of an increased, albeit small, risk of cancer. The foods were all made with worcestershire sauce which contained the chili powder. All chili powder imported since July 2003 must be certified free of the agent. Since worcestershire sauce takes a long time to mature, the powder probably entered Britain before the ban. Britain ordered a thorough investigation. The discovery has sparked an international food safety alert.\", 'On November 13, 2005, an explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company released 100 tons of pollutants, including high-density benzene and nitrobenzene, into the Songhua River in NE China, to create a 50-mile slick of floating chemicals. Water quality was monitored constantly and active carbon added. Patrols enforced non-use by humans or animals. China kept Russia informed since the Songhua joins the Amur border river. The Songhua supplies drinking water for Harbin, a city of over 3 million. Harbin cut off its water supply for four days. Pollutant density declined with sedimentation, adsorbtion, and', \"A massive tsunami hit coastal communities from southern Asia to Africa on 26 December, killing at least 150,000 people in 11 countries. It was caused by the biggest earthquake in 40 years, 8.7 on the Richter scale, off Indonesia's Sumatra Island. Indonesia was the hardest hit, with at least 90,000 dead. and its Aceh province was devastated with at least 500,00 homeless. Sri Lanka and the Maldives also suffered tremendous losses and damage.

Kuwait, Egypt, and Lebanon have reported successful use of hypnotism in treating obesity.', \"Tropical rain forests, such as those in China, Malaysia, Brazil, and several African nations, contain many rare species of flora and fauna. Threats to these forests include encroachment by farms and industrialization. Significant efforts are underway in China to enlarge and preserve these forests, including planting, prohibition or limitation on tree-cutting and factory building, relocation of farmers, and anti-poaching patrols. Malaysia has a joint satellite project with Brazil to monitor rain forests and analyze the satellites' data.

In July 1999 Soeharto suffered a stroke. On Oct. 18 the acting Attorney General said the investigation of corruption would be discontinued due to lack of evidence. After wide spread objections the incumbent Attorney General Marzuki Darusman reopened the case in December.

On June 26, the release of Paul and the disc jockey was ordered. On July 4, the release of the Kalpoes brothers also was ordered. Joran remained in custody through July 16 and can be held until September 4. The search for Holloway continued unsuccessfully and involved a Texas rescue group, FBI, Dutch Marines, police, islanders, and tourists. An Aruba official said there was no evidence to support a murder charge and as of July 16 no charges have been issued\", \"Eight days after the abduction, rebels allowed a doctor and several journalists to visit the hostages, held on a southwest Philippine island by 50 or more gunmen. Government soldiers have sealed off the area. The doctor brought medicine, food, and clothes to the 21 hostages suffering from hunger, diarrhea, and thirst. Eleven boxes of supplies were provided by the French, German, and Finnish embassies. The captives' embassies rejected a rebel demand for direct negotiations. The rebels are also demanding a multi-million dollar ransom. Officials do not think that this abduction is related to an earlier abduction of 27 hostages.\", 'Food recalls continue to affect thousands of tons of food distributed throughout the U.S. partly because it is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of various bacteria. Products have been recalled because they fail to meet USDA quality standards or because their production areas were unsanitary; meat products because of listeria monocytogenes and E. coli bacteria; taco shells because they were made with genetically engineered corn that had not been approved for human consumption; and other foods because their labels have failed to identify allergens such as buttermilk or whey as possible ingredients.', \"Marion County prosecutors dropped the charges against Deborah Lafave after they concluded that the victim's emotional state was more important than a prison sentence for Lafave. This means the previously agreed-upon deal will stand. The Marion County judge who had balked at the deal had been criticized by that county's prosecutor for factual errors in his rejection of the plea. He also was presented with psychiatric opinions concerning damage to the victim's emotional state that a trial could cause. If convicted in Marion County Lafave could have faced even more prison time than she would have had in Hillsborough County.\", 'Australia and New Zealand are strongly opposed to Japan\\'s plans to seek approval at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to enlarge its catch of whales in Antarctica. Japan wants to almost double its catch of Minke whales and add humpback and fin whales, both of which are endangered. There is a moratorium on commercial whaling, but Japan hunts them under a loophole that allows \"research whaling\". It does not recognize Australia\\'s claim of sovereignty over Australian Antarctic Territory. Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway could get a majority vote at the IWC.', 'At the end of March, 1999, a month after the deadly Austrian avalanches, the hardest hit resort, Galtuer, reported that 32 ski vacationers and 6 villagers had been killed.

The listing succeeded with numbers increasing from around 200 in 1982 to near 600 in 2005. This success led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to propose delisting some parts of the protected area. The National Resources Council, the Sierra Club, and other groups opposed delisting, citing the encroachment of housing developments and diminished food supply. A decision about delisting was due mid-February 2006.', 'Protective helmets can reduce head injuries in bicyclists and motorcyclists and are often required by law.

The judge rejected Kaczynski's request to dismiss his attorneys and the trial resumed Thursday. Two weeks later, he pleaded guilty unconditionally to all Federal charges, giving up any appeal rights. On May 4, Kaczynski was sentenced to four life terms without the possibility of release and prohibited from any action in which he could profit from his crimes. Before the trial, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, recognizing Kaczynski's mental illness, and allow him to plead guilty to all the crimes.\", 'In Baluchistan on Thursday, March 17, 2005, in an escalation of violence after a January 2nd rape, Bugti tribesmen attacked a Pakistani Frontier Corps convoy and shelled a military base.

Producers claim it increases energy, helps take off weight, tones muscles, and increases sexual sensation. Millions of people, especially athletes, are taking this supplement. Its unsupervised sale was made possible by 1994 legislation which removed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of diet products.

The leak, which could have caused a catastrophic explosion, was contained 18 hours after it was reported. There was no evidence of oil leaked into the water, and there were no injuries. Statoil's request to restart operations would not be granted until an inspection by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority.\", \"The South Korean president initiated an investigation of illegal wire-tapping by NIS (the intelligence service). This produced 274 illegal recordings, and led to the arrests of a retired NIS official, who had kept an illegal tape, and the businessman to whom he gave it, who then leaked it to the media. It resulted in the resignation of the ambassador to the U.S., heard on the tape in an incriminating conversation with a Samsung executive, discussing allegedly illegal political contributions. Samsung apologized and filed a libel suit. NIS' current chief admitted his agency's earlier bugging operations. The media are being questioned.\", \"In 2005, conservationists in Sri Lanka discovered thirty-five new species of frogs but also determined that nineteen species had died out. Diminishment of other species continued, such as the harlequin frog and the golden toad in Central and South America, and the mountain yellow-legged frog in California. Part of this loss of biodiversity has been blamed on global warming's impact on the deadly chytrid fungus, which grows on frogs' skin. Other waterborne dangers encountered by frogs are the chemical DEET used in insect repellents, fluoxetine which is the active ingredient in Prozac, and carbamaze\", 'A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body. This is not always the case with other diseases suspected of being caused by dioxin.

Suspects include Vladimir Putin or the Russian mafia hired by Putin or Ukrainian officials to keep the Ukraine within the Russian sphere. Even Yushchenko's inner circle was mentioned. The poison was firmly identified as tetra-chloro-dibanzo-dioxin, which typically takes from 3 to 14 days for symptoms to appear, raising the question when and where the poisoning actually occurred. This poison will disfigure and sicken a victim, but not kill quickly. A parliamentary commission investigation was begun, but Yushchenko refused to cooperate. He expects to\", 'Proposals to preserve the Maryland oyster include placing them on the endangered species list. However since no regional specificity is allowed for invertebrates a resulting ban would be on all oysters, everywhere. Since oysters are a natural filter against pollution, restoring their numbers would contribute to cleaning Chesapeake waters but this could take decades. Supporters of introducing the Asian oyster say they grow bigger and faster, and would add the filtering capacity needed. Such a step is irreversible, however. No decision has been made. Genetic altering of native oysters to made them disease-resistant has been proposed.', 'On 4 October 2005 there were two instances of steam arising from Mount Saint Helens, this followed next day when thousands of tourists were delighted by another burst of steam and ash but with subsequent lessening of large earthquake activity.

The opposition and France called for an international commission, while the opposition also demanded the Prime Minister's resignation.\", \"Britain's Food Standards Agency ordered 474 foods recalled because they contain the dye Sudan I, used to color products like oils and shoe polish. The EU has banned its use in foods because of an increased, albeit small, risk of cancer. The foods were all made with worcestershire sauce which contained the chili powder. All chili powder imported since July 2003 must be certified free of the agent. Since worcestershire sauce takes a long time to mature, the powder probably entered Britain before the ban.

Other waterborne dangers encountered by frogs are the chemical DEET used in insect repellents, fluoxetine which is the active ingredient in Prozac, and carbamaze\", 'A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body. This is not always the case with other diseases suspected of being caused by dioxin. Agent Orange may have been tested in Panama prior to deployment in Vietnam, thus affecting many Panamanians and Americans. There are unconfirmed reports that it was also used in Korea. Vietnam claims one million victims of Agent orange in his country. The government will provide monthly allowances for affected citizens and their disabled children.', \"Speculation grew on who poisoned Victor Yushchenko. Suspects include Vladimir Putin or the Russian mafia hired by Putin or Ukrainian officials to keep the Ukraine within the Russian sphere. Even Yushchenko's inner circle was mentioned. The poison was firmly identified as tetra-chloro-dibanzo-dioxin, which typically takes from 3 to 14 days for symptoms to appear, raising the question when and where the poisoning actually occurred. This poison will disfigure and sicken a victim, but not kill quickly. A parliamentary commission investigation was begun, but Yushchenko refused to cooperate. He expects to\", 'Proposals to preserve the Maryland oyster include placing them on the endangered species list. However since no regional specificity is allowed for invertebrates a resulting ban would be on all oysters, everywhere. Since oysters are a natural filter against pollution, restoring their numbers would contribute to cleaning Chesapeake waters but this could take decades. Supporters of introducing the Asian oyster say they grow bigger and faster, and would add the filtering capacity needed. Such a step is irreversible, however. No decision has been made. Genetic altering of native oysters to made them disease-resistant has been proposed.', 'On 4 October 2005 there were two instances of steam arising from Mount Saint Helens, this followed next day when thousands of tourists were delighted by another burst of steam and ash but with subsequent lessening of large earthquake activity. The U.S. Geologic Survey anticipated that underground molten rock termed magma would continue to rise and announced the area should get used to living with an active volcano. However, on 6 October, that agency stated an eruption was not imminent, disappointing the thousands of tourists hoping to witness an eruption similar to the 1986 event.', 'In Amsterdam, on 2 November 2004, Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the famed artist, was killed by a Muslim extremist, in apparent retaliation for the showing on TV of Theo\\'s film \"Submission\", which depicted the spousal abuse of four Muslim women. The dual Dutch and Moroccan assailant, not further identified, who left a note attached to van Gogh, was arrested immediately after the attack. The shooting heightened already strained relations between the million Muslim minority and the normally tolerant but now threatened Dutch. Immigrant groups condemned the slaying but emphasized assimilation was difficult when feeling unwanted.', \"After a 12-week trial and 9 days of deliberation, jurors found Blake not guilty of killing his wife or of solicitating murder. Jurors didn't believe the stuntmen. Prosecutors claimed Blake feared Bakley would corrupt their daughter. M. Gerry Schwartzbach took Blake's defense after three previous counselors quit. Blake never testified. Blake gave a rambling, profane, emotional interview to reporters and cut the electronic monitor off his leg. He said he was broke and needed a job. The judge returned his passport. Blake planned to roam around and get revitalized. Fans celebrated at Vit\", \"Coral reefs provide seafood and livelihood for one billion Asians alone, many from impoverished areas. Over 58% of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, over-fishing, disease, and climate change. Reefs suffer from hurricanes and El Nino-triggered bleaching. Coral reef damage from the late December Indian Ocean tsunamis is yet to be assessed. About 30% of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down from 41% two years ago. About two-fifths of those damaged in the 1998 El Nino bleaching have since recovered. Taiwan is constructing artificial reefs to act as foundations to support new living\", \"Pfc. Lynndie England pleaded guilty to humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghad late in 2003. In hearings, England said her actions were wrong but early in the trial she contradicted that statement. Judge Col. Pohl stopped her and said he didn't want her to plead guilty unless she thought she was. Military judges cannot accept a guilty plea if the defendant doesn't accept guilt. If accepted, a military jury decides punishment and defendant gets the lesser of that or the plea agreed to by prosecutors. Defense attornies are Capt. Crisps and Rick Hernandez.\", \"Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a suicide car bomb February 14, 2005 in Beirut. Six of his body guards and 10 other were also killed with about 120 injured. Two Islamic terrorist groups claimed responsibility but opposition leaders blamed the Lebanese and Syrian governments. Hariri opposed Syrian intervention in the Lebanese presidential term and was working to make a comeback in the May election. The opposition, France, and the US called for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops. The opposition and France called for an international commission, while the opposition also demanded the Prime Minister's resignation.\", \"Britain's Food Standards Agency ordered 474 foods recalled because they contain the dye Sudan I, used to color products like oils and shoe polish. The EU has banned its use in foods because of an increased, albeit small, risk of cancer. The foods were all made with worcestershire sauce which contained the chili powder. All chili powder imported since July 2003 must be certified free of the agent. Since worcestershire sauce takes a long time to mature, the powder probably entered Britain before the ban. Britain ordered a thorough investigation. The discovery has sparked an international food safety alert.\", 'On November 13, 2005, an explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company released 100 tons of pollutants, including high-density benzene and nitrobenzene, into the Songhua River in NE China, to create a 50-mile slick of floating chemicals. Water quality was monitored constantly and active carbon added. Patrols enforced non-use by humans or animals. China kept Russia informed since the Songhua joins the Amur border river. The Songhua supplies drinking water for Harbin, a city of over 3 million. Harbin cut off its water supply for four days. Pollutant density declined with sedimentation, adsorbtion, and', \"A massive tsunami hit coastal communities from southern Asia to Africa on 26 December, killing at least 150,000 people in 11 countries. It was caused by the biggest earthquake in 40 years, 8.7 on the Richter scale, off Indonesia's Sumatra Island. Indonesia was the hardest hit, with at least 90,000 dead. and its Aceh province was devastated with at least 500,00 homeless. Sri Lanka and the Maldives also suffered tremendous losses and damage. International aid has been sent from a host of countries, including the US, Japan, Australia, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, Denmark, and Switzerland.\"]\n"

Officials do not think that this abduction is related to an earlier abduction of 27 hostages.\", 'Food recalls continue to affect thousands of tons of food distributed throughout the U.S. partly because it is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of various bacteria. Products have been recalled because they fail to meet USDA quality standards or because their production areas were unsanitary; meat products because of listeria monocytogenes and E. coli bacteria; taco shells because they were made with genetically engineered corn that had not been approved for human consumption; and other foods because their labels have failed to identify allergens such as buttermilk or whey as possible ingredients.', \"Marion County prosecutors dropped the charges against Deborah Lafave after they concluded that the victim's emotional state was more important than a prison sentence for Lafave. This means the previously agreed-upon deal will stand. The Marion County judge who had balked at the deal had been criticized by that county's prosecutor for factual errors in his rejection of the plea. He also was presented with psychiatric opinions concerning damage to the victim's emotional state that a trial could cause. If convicted in Marion County Lafave could have faced even more prison time than she would have had in Hillsborough County.\", 'Australia and New Zealand are strongly opposed to Japan\\'s plans to seek approval at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to enlarge its catch of whales in Antarctica. Japan wants to almost double its catch of Minke whales and add humpback and fin whales, both of which are endangered. There is a moratorium on commercial whaling, but Japan hunts them under a loophole that allows \"research whaling\". It does not recognize Australia\\'s claim of sovereignty over Australian Antarctic Territory. Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway could get a majority vote at the IWC.', 'At the end of March, 1999, a month after the deadly Austrian avalanches, the hardest hit resort, Galtuer, reported that 32 ski vacationers and 6 villagers had been killed. At least two deaths had been reported earlier in the town of Valzur. Few ski tourists came to the resort in March, usually their busiest time. The avalanches were considered the most dangerous in 400 years, with speeds of nearly 200 kilometers per hour.', \"The Arab League, Iran and Yemen condemned the U.S. attack on Sudan. Turkey, Israel and Britain supported it. Jordan preferred dispute-solution through dialog. Egypt asked the UN to host a summit on combating terrorism. At Sudan's request, the Arab League will meet to discuss the attack. Sudan planned to prevent U.S. over-flights. President el-Bashir said Sudanese were prepared to die in a holy war.

The listing succeeded with numbers increasing from around 200 in 1982 to near 600 in 2005. This success led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to propose delisting some parts of the protected area. The National Resources Council, the Sierra Club, and other groups opposed delisting, citing the encroachment of housing developments and diminished food supply. A decision about delisting was due mid-February 2006.', 'Protective helmets can reduce head injuries in bicyclists and motorcyclists and are often required by law.

The judge rejected Kaczynski's request to dismiss his attorneys and the trial resumed Thursday. Two weeks later, he pleaded guilty unconditionally to all Federal charges, giving up any appeal rights. On May 4, Kaczynski was sentenced to four life terms without the possibility of release and prohibited from any action in which he could profit from his crimes. Before the trial, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, recognizing Kaczynski's mental illness, and allow him to plead guilty to all the crimes.\", 'In Baluchistan on Thursday, March 17, 2005, in an escalation of violence after a January 2nd rape, Bugti tribesmen attacked a Pakistani Frontier Corps convoy and shelled a military base. A cease-fire ended day-long fighting in Dera Bugti. Up to 45 died. Others died from bombs on trains (placed by the Baluchistan Liberation Army), in Turbat and Quetta, and 39 at a Fatahpur shrine.

Producers claim it increases energy, helps take off weight, tones muscles, and increases sexual sensation. Millions of people, especially athletes, are taking this supplement. Its unsupervised sale was made possible by 1994 legislation which removed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of diet products. The deaths of 40 and incidents involving 800 have caused the FDA to try to limit supplements to 8 mgs per dose, 24 mgs per day.

The leak, which could have caused a catastrophic explosion, was contained 18 hours after it was reported. There was no evidence of oil leaked into the water, and there were no injuries. Statoil's request to restart operations would not be granted until an inspection by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority.\", \"The South Korean president initiated an investigation of illegal wire-tapping by NIS (the intelligence service). This produced 274 illegal recordings, and led to the arrests of a retired NIS official, who had kept an illegal tape, and the businessman to whom he gave it, who then leaked it to the media. It resulted in the resignation of the ambassador to the U.S., heard on the tape in an incriminating conversation with a Samsung executive, discussing allegedly illegal political contributions. Samsung apologized and filed a libel suit. NIS' current chief admitted his agency's earlier bugging operations. The media are being questioned.\", \"In 2005, conservationists in Sri Lanka discovered thirty-five new species of frogs but also determined that nineteen species had died out. Diminishment of other species continued, such as the harlequin frog and the golden toad in Central and South America, and the mountain yellow-legged frog in California. Part of this loss of biodiversity has been blamed on global warming's impact on the deadly chytrid fungus, which grows on frogs' skin. Other waterborne dangers encountered by frogs are the chemical DEET used in insect repellents, fluoxetine which is the active ingredient in Prozac, and carbamaze\", 'A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body. This is not always the case with other diseases suspected of being caused by dioxin. Agent Orange may have been tested in Panama prior to deployment in Vietnam, thus affecting many Panamanians and Americans. There are unconfirmed reports that it was also used in Korea. Vietnam claims one million victims of Agent orange in his country. The government will provide monthly allowances for affected citizens and their disabled children.', \"Speculation grew on who poisoned Victor Yushchenko. Suspects include Vladimir Putin or the Russian mafia hired by Putin or Ukrainian officials to keep the Ukraine within the Russian sphere. Even Yushchenko's inner circle was mentioned. The poison was firmly identified as tetra-chloro-dibanzo-dioxin, which typically takes from 3 to 14 days for symptoms to appear, raising the question when and where the poisoning actually occurred. This poison will disfigure and sicken a victim, but not kill quickly. A parliamentary commission investigation was begun, but Yushchenko refused to cooperate. He expects to\", 'Proposals to preserve the Maryland oyster include placing them on the endangered species list. However since no regional specificity is allowed for invertebrates a resulting ban would be on all oysters, everywhere. Since oysters are a natural filter against pollution, restoring their numbers would contribute to cleaning Chesapeake waters but this could take decades. Supporters of introducing the Asian oyster say they grow bigger and faster, and would add the filtering capacity needed. Such a step is irreversible, however. No decision has been made. Genetic altering of native oysters to made them disease-resistant has been proposed.', 'On 4 October 2005 there were two instances of steam arising from Mount Saint Helens, this followed next day when thousands of tourists were delighted by another burst of steam and ash but with subsequent lessening of large earthquake activity. The U.S. Geologic Survey anticipated that underground molten rock termed magma would continue to rise and announced the area should get used to living with an active volcano. However, on 6 October, that agency stated an eruption was not imminent, disappointing the thousands of tourists hoping to witness an eruption similar to the 1986 event.', 'In Amsterdam, on 2 November 2004, Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the famed artist, was killed by a Muslim extremist, in apparent retaliation for the showing on TV of Theo\\'s film \"Submission\", which depicted the spousal abuse of four Muslim women. The dual Dutch and Moroccan assailant, not further identified, who left a note attached to van Gogh, was arrested immediately after the attack. The shooting heightened already strained relations between the million Muslim minority and the normally tolerant but now threatened Dutch. Immigrant groups condemned the slaying but emphasized assimilation was difficult when feeling unwanted.', \"After a 12-week trial and 9 days of deliberation, jurors found Blake not guilty of killing his wife or of solicitating murder.

Hariri opposed Syrian intervention in the Lebanese presidential term and was working to make a comeback in the May election. The opposition, France, and the US called for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops. The opposition and France called for an international commission, while the opposition also demanded the Prime Minister's resignation.\", \"Britain's Food Standards Agency ordered 474 foods recalled because they contain the dye Sudan I, used to color products like oils and shoe polish. The EU has banned its use in foods because of an increased, albeit small, risk of cancer. The foods were all made with worcestershire sauce which contained the chili powder. All chili powder imported since July 2003 must be certified free of the agent. Since worcestershire sauce takes a long time to mature, the powder probably entered Britain before the ban. Britain ordered a thorough investigation.

Symptoms occur when 80%of dopamine producing cells die and can include loss of balance. Recent research has found a flaw in the LRRK2 gene may cause 4% of the cases. Other causes are suspected environmental, such as exposure to chemicals and radiation. Many nations are involved with stem cell research and Parkinson's. Tobacco may provide some protection. In trials, GDNF from Amgen Company showed some success. The success was attributed to the placebo effect and Amgen stopped testing the drug. Trials have found deep brain stimulation may help alleviate symptoms.\", 'VIOXX, an arthritis drug used by 2 million people, was withdrawn from the market by Merck, after determination that use past 18 months increased the risk of heart attack or strokes, one researcher estimating a resultant 30,000 to 100,000 deaths. The withdrawal brought attention to the issues of advertising and FDA oversight. Critics complained that TV advertising caused arthritics to desire the drug when OTC drugs cost less and worked equally well. Congress questioned if the FDA devoted sufficient time to approval. Senator Grassley opined whether there was too cozy an arrangement between the FDA and drug companies.', 'The number of confirmed bird flu cases in Hong Kong rose to 13 and officials ordered slaughter of approximately 1 million chickens and raising importation standards. A joint Hong Kong, U.S., WHO examination of the problem confirmed that the main mode of H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human. The antibody was detected mainly among poultry workers and people directly exposed to the virus. Neighboring Macao officials were concerned but reported no cases. Nepal officials reported no cases but emphasized they did not import poultry from China. The Central Chinese government temporarily suspended chicken exports.', 'A GAO report panned the 10-year Chesapeake Bay clean-up program, citing misleading reports and statistics. Meanwhile, a new cooperative program is hoped to ease tension between bay people and farmers, who are often blamed for agricultural pollution. Student activity includes planting foliage buffers to filter runoff. Crabmeat is highlighted in a Save-the-Bay campaign warning against lawn fertilizer that can wind up in the Chesapeake. Power plants are targeted for their harmful nitrogen-laden runoff. A petition to list the oyster as an endangered species is being reviewed but there is strong opposition; such a move could devastate the seafood industry.', \"The grand jury hearing testimony and reviewing evidence related to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, was granted an extension to mid-October 1999. Under State law, grand jury proceedings are secret but media speculation says evidence points to either a family member or an intruder having committed the murder. The grand jury didn't meet for more than 3 months while detectives conducted additional investigations. The grand jury can issue indictments, choose not to indict, write an opinion report, or simply adjourn. Depending on the outcome, the DA can pursue any jury recommendation or empanel another group to start anew.\", 'Mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) appeared in Britain in 1986. It infected beef that had eaten feed containing animal brain and nervous tissue. Mad cow spread through Europe and Asia, with isolated cases found in North America. People who ate contaminated beef products, especially nervous system tissue, or received a contaminated blood transfusion contracted the human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob. After at least 10 years victims experience personality change, loss of body functions, brain deterioration, and death. By 2004, 151 people had contracted the disease. Prevention includes killing herds, banning meat product in animal', \"About 8 million people suffer from eating-related psychiatric disorders; 20% die from it. Anorexics starve themselves, bulimics purge what they eat, purge-eaters purge but maintain weight, and binge-eaters just keep eating. Causes include depression, stress from life events, and a need to control some aspect in one's life. Anorexics and bulimics tend to be in denial. They conceal their food-avoidance, which can lead to weakened hearts and osteoporosis. Binge-eating disorder results in overweight, with accompanying life-threatening ailments like hypertension and cancer.\", 'Medical evidence supports the theory that Flight 522 suffered cabin decompression that possibly incapacitated both pilots. Reports suggest they may have failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning. There are media reports that a switch that controls cabin pressure may have been left in the wrong position after a safely check. The same aircraft lost cabin pressure in December when a door was not properly sealed. Another man onboard, probably a flight attendant, attempted to steer the plane just before it crashed. Ultimately, after having flown for hours on autopilot, the plane crashed when it ran out of fuel.', 'Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime, and one which evolves with each advance in technology. Banks and businesses lose up to an estimated $4 billion annually. Employee access to sensitive personal information increases the risk of identity theft. Individual victims spend countless dollars and hours over the course of months or years in their efforts to restore their good names and credit. The new Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 makes the crime a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. On January 1, California became the ninth state to prosecute identity theft as a crime.', 'Obesity is a major health problem since people who are overweight have increased tendencies toward cardiovascular and cerebral disease, diabetes and kidney and liver disease. In China about 70 million are obese. A survey in 1996 in Shanghai found that 12.6% of adults and 11.35% of children are obese. The incidence in Britain is 16% of women and 13% of men; in Kuwait, 42% of women and 28% of men. The main causes of obesity are lack of regular exercise and poor diet.

Government soldiers have sealed off the area. The doctor brought medicine, food, and clothes to the 21 hostages suffering from hunger, diarrhea, and thirst. Eleven boxes of supplies were provided by the French, German, and Finnish embassies. The captives' embassies rejected a rebel demand for direct negotiations. The rebels are also demanding a multi-million dollar ransom. Officials do not think that this abduction is related to an earlier abduction of 27 hostages.\", 'Food recalls continue to affect thousands of tons of food distributed throughout the U.S. partly because it is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of various bacteria. Products have been recalled because they fail to meet USDA quality standards or because their production areas were unsanitary; meat products because of listeria monocytogenes and E. coli bacteria; taco shells because they were made with genetically engineered corn that had not been approved for human consumption; and other foods because their labels have failed to identify allergens such as buttermilk or whey as possible ingredients.', \"Marion County prosecutors dropped the charges against Deborah Lafave after they concluded that the victim's emotional state was more important than a prison sentence for Lafave. This means the previously agreed-upon deal will stand. The Marion County judge who had balked at the deal had been criticized by that county's prosecutor for factual errors in his rejection of the plea. He also was presented with psychiatric opinions concerning damage to the victim's emotional state that a trial could cause. If convicted in Marion County Lafave could have faced even more prison time than she would have had in Hillsborough County.\", 'Australia and New Zealand are strongly opposed to Japan\\'s plans to seek approval at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to enlarge its catch of whales in Antarctica.

Simpson faces 11 charges, including felony charges of kidnapping, assault with a weapon, armed robbery, burglary, conspiracy, and coercion. The kidnapping charge carries a possible life sentence. Police seized evidence, including two firearms, at a private residence Sunday. Simpson was released on $125,000 bail without entering a plea. One co-defendant agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges and testify against the others. Simpson is due in Las Vegas District Court for a preliminary hearing in November.', 'Some popular toys made in China for US companies, including Thomas & Friends and TV character toys, are unsafe for children mostly because of paint containing lead. Lead ingested by putting toys in mouths can cause brain and kidney damage and affect muscle and bone growth of children under 6. Eighty percent of US toys are now made in China, where required safety procedures are not always followed. Toymakers recalled the toys and fired the Chinese subcontractors. The insufficiently resourced Consumer Product Safety Commission is investigating and talking with China. Congressional bills propose strengthening the CPSC and ending manufacturers self-monitoring.']\n"
