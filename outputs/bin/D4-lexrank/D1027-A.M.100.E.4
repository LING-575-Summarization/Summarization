The day before one of the men accused of killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence.
 During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later.
 The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
 Henderson's trial was originally set for March 22.
