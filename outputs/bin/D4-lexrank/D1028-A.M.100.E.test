The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
 Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of those bombings, which killed two men and wounded others.
 He is also charged with a third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
 The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
 Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
