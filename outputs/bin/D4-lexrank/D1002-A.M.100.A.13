When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said, at least one of the officers wept.
 Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which hit him.
 Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment.
