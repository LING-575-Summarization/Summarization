Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.
 The story also said Gary McLarty told his son that "he almost threw up when he heard Bonny Bakley was dead" and he thought Blake was behind it.
 Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
 Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley.

The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley . Other witnesses spoke of his anxiety when he found out Bakley was pregnant and his desire to get her out of his life but to keep the baby that he loved.
 Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.
