Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
 The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
 China has informed Russia of the water pollution situation in the country's northeastern Songhua River, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said here on Thursday.
