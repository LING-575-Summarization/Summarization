There have been many large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year, including one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157: H7.
 To its credit, the Agriculture Department has announced recalls of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other companies in the last four months, most recently last weekend.
 Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.

According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration greater authority to halt imports of fruits, vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to give the Department of Agriculture new authority to impose tough fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.'' 
 The government has no reliable tracking system, but health officials say food-borne diseases account for up to 30 million cases of illness and 9,000 deaths a year
