The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years . Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition . Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.
 According to the National Eating Disorder Association, about 7 million U.S. females and 1 million males suffer from an eating disorder . Anorexia and bulimia typically begin in early to mid-adolescence . About one out of every five people with an eating disorder will die from the disease.
