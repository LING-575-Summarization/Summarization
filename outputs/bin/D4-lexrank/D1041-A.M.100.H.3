After global warming blamed for higher water temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations threats to the reefs include coral disease, overfishing, coastal development and pollution runoff from land-based sources.
 But a combination of global warming, pollution, overfishing, diseases and other factors is ravaging reefs worldwide.
 For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
 "The coral reef system might be totally destroyed.

Regional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia with the IUCN (World Conservation Union) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Jerker Tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be "very, very serious." 
 Tamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just beginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water temperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern.
