Van Gogh said he had received threats after the airing of his movie "Submission," which he made with a right-wing Dutch politician who had renounced the Islamic faith of her birth.

 After it became known that van Gogh's alleged killer was of Moroccan descent, politicians and commentators feared ethnic tensions and called for calm.
