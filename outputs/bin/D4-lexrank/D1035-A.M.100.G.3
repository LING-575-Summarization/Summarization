A review of what has been done to determine how Agent Orange and other herbicides affected Vietnam veterans confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended 24 years ago.
 He said Vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange, and veterans with any of the 10 diseases is presumed to have contracted it from the exposure, without individual proof.
 Only later did he come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.

Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
