Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
 The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
 Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.
