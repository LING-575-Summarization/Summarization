The toxic benzene-contaminated water, flowing down from the upper reaches of Songhua, arrived at the local water supply inlet at about 5 a.m., and has now entered river sections across the city's urban areas, according to the Heilongjiang provincial environment protection bureau.
 The 80-kilometer-long (50-mile-long) swathe of chemicals moved downstream into Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, on Thursday, prompting officials to shut down water supplies.
