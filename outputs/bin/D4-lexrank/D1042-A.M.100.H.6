England had faced up to 16 1/2 years in prison if convicted on all full nine counts, which included conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment and indecent acts . But one of her lawyers, Capt . Jonathan Crisp, said last week that England would enter a guilty plea at the pretrial hearing Monday on seven counts and then face sentencing by a military jury . The reduced charges carry a maximum sentence of 11 years.
