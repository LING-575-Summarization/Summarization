In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.
 The three weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family knew of them.
