According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
 The first signs of mad cow disease emerged in Britain 10 years earlier, in 1986, but the government there denied there was any danger until the evidence became impossible to ignore.
