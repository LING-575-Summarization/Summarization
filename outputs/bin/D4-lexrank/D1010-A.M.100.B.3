Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle . It appeared in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry . Cases have also been detected in the United States and Canada.
 Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated.
 The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
