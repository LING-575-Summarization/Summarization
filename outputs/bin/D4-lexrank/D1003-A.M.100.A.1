Currently, more than 1,500 giant pandas live in the wild in the country, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
 The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said.
 Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow . Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
