Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
 Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
 The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs.
 Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.

"There is a huge natural cost, but what it is is still to be determined," said Lynne Hale, director of the global marine initiative for the Nature Conservancy, who worked in Thailand's Phuket Island and Sri Lanka for many years . Both areas were hard hit by the tsunami.

The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
Tamelander says in some cases mangroves, which protect the shore from erosion and often serve as nurseries for young fish, would also have been completel0 years," he said.
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
