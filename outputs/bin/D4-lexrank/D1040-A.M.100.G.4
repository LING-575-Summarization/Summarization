During his daylong summation of the two-month trial, M. Gerald Schwartzbach also disputed the accounts of several prosecution witnesses that Blake acted oddly the night his wife was killed, and denied that his client was acting when he wailed and moaned at the crime scene.
 He said another key prosecution witness, former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user Gary McLarty, testified that Blake never asked him to kill anybody, adding that he had "assumed" that was what the actor wanted.
