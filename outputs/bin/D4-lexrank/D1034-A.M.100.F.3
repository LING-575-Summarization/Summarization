The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species . The three-year, $1.5 million study, which involved more than 500 scientists from more than 60 countries, is being published Friday in the journal Science.
 "These are simply stunning results," Wake said of the report, published in the online version of the journal Science . "Nearly one-third of all the species are in the three top categories of endangerment, and nearly half the declines for unknown causes."
 About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
