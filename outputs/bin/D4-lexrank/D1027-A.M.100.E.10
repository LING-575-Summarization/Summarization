The day before one of the men accused of killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence.
 The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant.
 During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later.
