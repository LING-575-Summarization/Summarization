A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
 Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
 Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
 The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.

Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of this area . It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951 . A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.
 Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China . The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.

The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare plants to a special 90-ha area for protection.
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
