Hariri, who came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years, resigned last October.
 Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut earlier in the day.
 Hariri, at least five bodyguards and four other people were killed in a massive bombing that blasted his motorcade on a Beirut seafront street earlier Monday.
 The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
