The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley . Other witnesses spoke of his anxiety when he found out Bakley was pregnant and his desire to get her out of his life but to keep the baby that he loved.
 Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.
