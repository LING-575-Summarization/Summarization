The crash, the worst air disaster in Greece and the worst involving a Cypriot airline, perplexed aviation experts astounded by what appeared to have been a catastrophic failure of cabin pressure or oxygen supply at 10 km up.
 Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said.
 One of the pilots appeared to have fallen ill or unconscious, according to reports.
