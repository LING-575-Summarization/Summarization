But Dr. Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein that clumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually saves cells from dying.
 (That breakthrough is not likely to come soon, scientists say, since Alzheimer's involves the loss of many kinds of brain cells.)
 In the experiment, they took neurons from the striatum, the brain region hard hit by Huntington's.
