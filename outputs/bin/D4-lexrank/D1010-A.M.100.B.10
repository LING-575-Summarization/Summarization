According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
 Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
