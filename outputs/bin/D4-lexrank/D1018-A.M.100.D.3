<<<<<<< HEAD
In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.
 Three suspects--Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, the son of a prominent judicial official, and brothers Satish Kalpoe, 18, and Deepak Kalpoe, 21--are still being held and are now the focus of an intensifying investigation into the disappearance of the girl.
=======
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
