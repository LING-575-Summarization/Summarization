Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Monday that an air-and-sea search team had determined where the hostages--half of whom were foreign tourists--were being held, following their abduction on the lush Sipadan Island in eastern Malaysia.
 A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track down the kidnappers.
 Malaysian officials said today that the kidnappers were believed to be outside Malaysian waters.

On March 2, gunmen from the al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf group kidnapped 21 people from a luxury resort in Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island. 
 The hostages were taken to the southern Philippines, where they were taken to two boats. 
 The gunmen then forced their captives to swim to two fishing boats, which sped away and appeared to be heading toward Philippine waters.
