NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case.
 The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political protest that has yet to abate.
