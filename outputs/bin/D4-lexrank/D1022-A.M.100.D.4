But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.
 The International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan's scientific hunt, in which hundreds of whales are killed each year, is widely regarded as a way of circumventing the moratorium.
 Ruddock said Australia was "vigorously opposed" to the Japanese proposals and would press its efforts to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
