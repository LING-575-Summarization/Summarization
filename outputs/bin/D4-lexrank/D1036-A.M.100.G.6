Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
 "There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment.
 Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
