The conservation union--which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species--also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
 About 65 percent of the Persian Gulf's reefs have been destroyed, the report said.
 More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.
