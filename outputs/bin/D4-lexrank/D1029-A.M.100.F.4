The tribesmen, who have demanded more revenues for natural resources extracted from their territory, often launch attacks on government targets in restive areas of Baluchistan, but violence has escalated this year and the army has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the gas fields.
 Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.
