Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday . "There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment."
 "It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup," Zimpfer said Saturday.
