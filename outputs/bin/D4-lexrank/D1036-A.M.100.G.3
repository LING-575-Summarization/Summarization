There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
 Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
