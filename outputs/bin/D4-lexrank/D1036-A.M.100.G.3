New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
