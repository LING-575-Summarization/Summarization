It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
 The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
 For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
 About 16 percent of global reefs had been damaged by the bleaching.
 Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.
