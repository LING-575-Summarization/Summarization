Following are the list of charges to which US soldier Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty here in relation to abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad:
 The interrogation produced repeated statements by England that soldiers abused Iraqis "for their own amusement," and admissions that she participated "because they asked me to."
 England became the eighth enlisted soldier to be found guilty of 2003 Abu Ghraib crimes that continue to taint the reputations of the United States and its military.
