The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m. when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No . 1157 . The officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived.
 McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and approached Diallo on the stoop . McMellon stood to the left and Carroll to the right as they mounted the steps.
 "There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were constantly getting different counts," Davis said.
