Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
 Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
