If convicted of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait, Blake could be sentenced to life in prison.
 Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
 He faces life in prison if he is convicted of murder.
 Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined.
