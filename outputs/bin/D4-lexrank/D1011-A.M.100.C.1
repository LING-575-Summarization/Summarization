Hecht says she doesn't talk about her eating disorder with her children, but she knows they love her and want her to stop.
 Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.
 "I was flying out there," she says.
 It became clear, she says, that she wasn't going to be able to achieve the way she had in high school.
 "I don't think I learned what I really enjoyed, I just performed.

Before she left home for treatment, Emma was feeling guilty that her illness was stressing out her family . "I've cried a lot because I look at what I'm doing to people who have tried to help me . That's why I need to go . I can't do this to them anymore," she said.

For Hecht, the eating disorders were part of her life for many years, but she didn't admit it to herself, and others, until the mid-1990s.
A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.
But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa."
