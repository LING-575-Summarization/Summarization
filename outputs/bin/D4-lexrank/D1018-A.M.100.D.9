Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.
 Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
 Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
 The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
