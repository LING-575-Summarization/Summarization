LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.
 "We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer," said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.
