As the Bush administration prepares to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list, a schism has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears remain at risk.
 Servheen of the Fish and Wildlife Service who is a strong advocate of delisting the Yellowstone grizzlies dismissed the resolutions as"colorful but meaningless, "saying that"a majority of people want bears around. "
