"There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning," he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic . The doctors, Zimpfer said, "suspect the involvement of an external party," and that the dioxin was given orally . "The criminal investigation does not fall within our purview," he added.
 The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
