Clevon Tilghman, 53, has been working at Harrison's since he was a boy watching his parents shuck oysters there . "Young people now don't want to shuck oysters," Tilghman said . "You can tell in the oyster house . We see the old generation that's passed on, and there's no younger one to take their place . It's fading out."
 "We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about," said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
