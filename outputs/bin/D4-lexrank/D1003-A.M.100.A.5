The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces . To protect the animal, dubbed China's "national treasure," the country has set up 33 nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.
 Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
