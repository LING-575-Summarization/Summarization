Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China . The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
 Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
 A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
 There are also many endangered and unique plants in the area.
