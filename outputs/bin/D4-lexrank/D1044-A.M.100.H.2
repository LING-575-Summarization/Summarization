Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
 The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
