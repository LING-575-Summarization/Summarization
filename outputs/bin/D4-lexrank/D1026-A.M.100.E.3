The concern over concussions, and whether headgear can protect against them, has become a growing issue for youth soccer associations.
 This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S. Soccer Federation, which contends that marketing to the fears of parents has trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing concussions.
 (The soccer federation says this involves low-level forces that don't cause concussions.)
 Many of these motorcyclist casualties could be avoided if there was widespread wearing of safety helmets.
