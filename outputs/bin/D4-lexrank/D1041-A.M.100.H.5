Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with other strains . For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts . And though symbiont D is widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not know whether all of them can support the strain.
 The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed . Another half are damaged but could be saved, it said.
