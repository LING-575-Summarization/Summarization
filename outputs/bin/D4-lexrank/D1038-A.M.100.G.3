Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may reflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a 1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested at least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more likely.
 The growing consensus among scientists is that new magma is probably entering the volcano's upper levels, possibly bringing with it volatile gases that could lead to eruptions, said Bill Steele at the University of Washington's seismic laboratory in Seattle.

Helens for 25 minutes early Sunday, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano came back to life. 
 The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes. 
 Friday's eruption brought hundreds of curiosity seekers to the area who were evacuated on Saturday from a five-mile (8 kilometer) radius around the mountain, including the USGS Johnson Ridge Observatory.
