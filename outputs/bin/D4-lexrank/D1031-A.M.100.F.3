Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
 "There is good evidence from previous events such as hurricanes and typhoons that the presence of mangroves certainly assists in reducing the impact on land," Davidson said.
 But others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.
