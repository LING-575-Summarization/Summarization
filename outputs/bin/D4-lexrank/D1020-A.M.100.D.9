In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
 And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of that year.
 Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22.
 The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
