The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica, @ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
 The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.
 Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay.
