The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
 In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
 The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is only found in poultry.
