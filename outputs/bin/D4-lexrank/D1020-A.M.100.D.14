There have been many large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year, including one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157: H7.
 Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.
 It's an increase from the corresponding period a year earlier when the Agriculture Department recorded just one listeria-related recall.
