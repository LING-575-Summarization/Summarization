Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
 Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold . The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a hospital.
 Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did not participate in Shepard's beating.
