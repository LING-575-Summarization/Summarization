Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of this area . It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951 . A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.
 Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China . The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
