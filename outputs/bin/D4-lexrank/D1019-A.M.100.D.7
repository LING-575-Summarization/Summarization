Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Monday that an air-and-sea search team had determined where the hostages--half of whom were foreign tourists--were being held, following their abduction on the lush Sipadan Island in eastern Malaysia.
 By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a mass abduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20 hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.
 Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
