Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs . The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
 Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for parents and schools . Decrying the violence and cruelty of pop culture, Gore said parents must cushion their children against hate.
 One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial sign and said: "Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better."
 Littleton needs comfort.
