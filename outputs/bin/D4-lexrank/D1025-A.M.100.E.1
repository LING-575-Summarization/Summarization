 "The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.

The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7 percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said . Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.

They contend that once exempt from the highest level of federal protection, the bears will be safe only inside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, areas too small to sustain a viable population of grizzlies.
Federal bear biologists contend the rust is moving more slowly in Yellowstone than in northwest Montana and that the trees have co-evolved with mountain pine beetles for thousands of years.
