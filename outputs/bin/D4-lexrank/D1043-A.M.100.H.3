<<<<<<< HEAD
Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
 He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
 But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination.
 Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside world.

Eventually, well over 100,000 marched down streets festooned with Lebanese flags, shouting "Syria Out" in protest of the dominant role Syria's forces have played in the country since the 1970s.
