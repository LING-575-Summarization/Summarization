Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
 Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
 There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.
 The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.

"A community formed around that high school, and the school grew as the community grew," said Gerry Difford, who opened Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years . "It has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a suburban high school."
 LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)--The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
 "For a lot of them, it's a chance to start healing," he said.

So many forms of community, rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to tell.
Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.
To prepare for the resumption of classes, some of Columbine's 158 teachers met Tuesday morning for the first time since two student gunmen fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives.
