"China is very concerned about the possible hazards to Russia and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said at a press conference.
 The Songhua River, a tributary of the Heilongjiang River which is called the Amur when it crosses the border, is contaminated by benzene due to a massive petrochemical plant explosion on November 13.
 "It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
 The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
