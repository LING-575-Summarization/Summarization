The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline--many for unknown reasons.
 In the United States, 21 percent of known species are threatened or extinct.
 The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species.

Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according to the report . Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water . Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat . The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are experiencing drought.
 "There may be an issue with frogs, that they are not warm and fuzzy," she said.

But they added that the phenomenon also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmental degradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals as well.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when it was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other species.
