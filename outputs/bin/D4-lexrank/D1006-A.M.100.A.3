The second article in the medical journal, by Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic, criticizes the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx even though hints of danger appeared years ago.
 "In light of Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx from the market and other recent news stories examining FDA's review of the safety and efficacy of anti-depressant drug use by children, I am concerned whether FDA has been sufficiently aggressive in monitoring drug safety," Davis wrote.

Merck recalled Vioxx in September 2004 after a study showed that it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes in older people taking it for at least three years. 
 The drug had been approved by the FDA in 1999 for arthritis. 
 Merck had promoted Vioxx as a way to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but the study showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
 Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx from the market raised questions about aggressive marketing of the drug before its long-term safety had been proven.
