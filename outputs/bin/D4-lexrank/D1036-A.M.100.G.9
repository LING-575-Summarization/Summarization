Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
 Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
 Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
