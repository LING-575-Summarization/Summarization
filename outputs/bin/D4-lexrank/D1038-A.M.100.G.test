A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
 "This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
 "We had to come back here when this happened," she said.
 "All this buildup was leading to that relatively small eruption."
