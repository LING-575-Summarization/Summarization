There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
 Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 "Friends, this is not a problem of cuisine as such," Yushchenko said then.
 "We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election," he said.
