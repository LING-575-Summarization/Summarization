Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
 Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "research whaling".
