Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
 The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C.
 The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
 Soedjono said that he has assigned junior Attorney General to carry out the investigation.
