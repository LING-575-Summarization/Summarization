Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
 Sixteen people in the devastated Arop village were confirmed dead, and two children had died in the Malalo village, which was wiped out.
 Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
