American Home Products declined to provide an executive to discuss its supplements business beyond issuing a statement through a public relations representative saying, "Herbals represent a large and growing market with increasing consumer acceptance."
 The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a shrublike plant grown widely in Asia . It can be found in more than 200 diet supplements, in pills and powders, drinks and diet bars, for sale in health food stores and on the Internet.
