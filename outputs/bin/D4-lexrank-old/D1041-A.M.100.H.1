The conservation union--which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species--also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
 The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities . But if the findings hold up, "they essentially buy us time" to address those issues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the new work.
 More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
