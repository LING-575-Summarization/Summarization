The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
 Canada, whose exports of beef products are effected by a single case of mad cow disease since may 2003, has exceeded its mad cow testing target for 2004, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported Sunday.
 No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
