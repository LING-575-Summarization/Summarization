HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua)--A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
 In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties . Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
