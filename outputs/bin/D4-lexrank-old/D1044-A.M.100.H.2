The Food Standards Agency said it was working with the food industry and local authorities to make sure that all the affected products are removed from the shelves and urged members of the public who have them in their cupboards to contact the store where they were bought for a refund.
 It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.
