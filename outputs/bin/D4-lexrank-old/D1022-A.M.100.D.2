Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that began in Ulsan, South Korea last week . Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have a voting majority at the commission for the first time since the 1986 whaling ban was imposed.
 But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.
