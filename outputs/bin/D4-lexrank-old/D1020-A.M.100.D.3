Two batches of Heinz baby food have been recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the Health Department said Monday.
 It said the department has also taken some samples of Heinz products for further testing.
 The problem was discovered in a routine Food and Drug Administration review of supermarket shelves.
 No illnesses have been reported.
