The rapid drop--the equivalent of tens of thousands of years worth of extinctions in just a century--is being caused by a range of factors that include deforestation, pollution, habitat loss and climate change, the researchers said . But they added that the phenomenon also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmental degradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals as well . Amphibians are often considered "canaries in the coal mine" because their permeable skin makes them especially sensitive to changing environmental conditions.
 Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.
