The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline--many for unknown reasons.
 They determined that 32.5 percent of amphibian species were threatened with extinction, compared with 12 percent of birds and 23 percent of mammals.
