Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
 The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a large consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce made by Premier Foods.
 The sauce was then added as an ingredient to at least 359 products made by supermarkets and leading food companies such as Unilever.
