If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current "threatened" status--a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest--officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat . The government would continue to monitor how state and federal authorities manage the land where the bears live to ensure their survival.
