Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four villages.
 The area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials built on beaches.
 Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said in a statement that a community school, government station, Catholic mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of Aitape had been completely destroyed.
