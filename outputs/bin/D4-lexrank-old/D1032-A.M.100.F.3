 The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
 On Tuesday, state-controlled oil company Statoil ASA said it hoped to get the platform running this week and build up to full production by Dec. 31.
