However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's wealth . It said it would be more relevant if the call for the probe into the riches of the former president and his family was made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.
 "The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal fortune . Should there be indications (that this wealth was amassed illegally), the government will pursue the case and take legal action," he told reporters.
