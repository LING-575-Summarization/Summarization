The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls . Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government spokesman said.
 Though the plane was out of radio contact with the ground for more than an hour after that, it appeared that at least some passengers remained conscious . Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit.
 A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
