Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
 On Sept. 15, six months after the grand jury was impaneled for a one-year term, District Attorney Alexander Hunter of Boulder County took the case before the grand jury . If the grand jurors investigate the case into the spring, as expected, their term will be extended for an additional six months.
 There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion . They have denied involvement.
