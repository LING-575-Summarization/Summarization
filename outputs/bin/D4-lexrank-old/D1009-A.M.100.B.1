Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
 Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
