If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current "threatened" status--a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest--officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat . The government would continue to monitor how state and federal authorities manage the land where the bears live to ensure their survival.
 Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
