In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996, six other diseases were listed as those with "limited or suggestive evidence of association" to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the contaminant dioxin . Added to the list then was spina bifida, the spinal birth defect found in the children of some Vietnam veterans.
 The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation for 10 diseases, as well as for the birth defect spina bifida, that have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the spraying in Vietnam.
