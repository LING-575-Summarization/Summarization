(Begin optional trim)
 In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., and several states vowed that the Chesapeake Bay would be cleaned up within 10 years . Since then, experts on the bay say it has become only slightly healthier . The blame is laid on a bureaucracy that spent the first half of the 10-year window on a marathon planning process . Here is the progress on a few of the important goals for the bay, based on information from the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program.
 The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale . In 2000, the foundation rated the bay a 28.
 "I'm certainly not going to tell you that we can't meet it," Hanmer said . "I don't think it's the right message to send."
 Subject...Goal...Progress
 The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for about $12 billion for cleaning up the bay.
