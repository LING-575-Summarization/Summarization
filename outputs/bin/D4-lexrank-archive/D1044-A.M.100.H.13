Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
 Determined to find out how traces of the illegal dye Sudan 1 found its way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.
 Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
