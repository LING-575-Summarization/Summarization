Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according to the report . Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water . Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat . The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are experiencing drought.
