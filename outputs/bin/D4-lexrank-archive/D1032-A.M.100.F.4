Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day . The country is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
 Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained "unclear" when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week.
