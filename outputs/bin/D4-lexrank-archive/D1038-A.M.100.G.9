Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
 The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the southern edge of a 1,000-foot (305-meter) -tall lava dome in the volcano's crater . Steam frequently rises from the crater, but the 8,364-foot (2,549-meter) peak had not erupted since 1986.
