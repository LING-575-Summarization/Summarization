ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
 The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the outside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.
 In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be canceled . Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.
