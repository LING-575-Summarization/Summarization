Britain's food watchdog said Thursday three companies were under investigation for their alleged role in a cancer scare that has triggered the country's largest food recall.
 It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.
 Determined to find out how traces of the dye found their way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.
