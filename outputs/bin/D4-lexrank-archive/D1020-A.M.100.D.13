Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22 . That recall, and one in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas, represent most of the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria contamination in recent years.
 The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products might contain the Listeria bacteria.
