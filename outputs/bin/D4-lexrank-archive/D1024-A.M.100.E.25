KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.
 About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons . Deep puddles of water on the muddy ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.
