Defense lawyers are expected to try to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors that the hermit is the same man who placed or mailed bombs that killed Sacramento computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985, and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray 10 years later.
 He faces a later trial in Newark, New Jersey, on federal charges that he mailed a package bomb that killed advertising executive Thomas Mosser in New Jersey . Kaczynski has also pleaded innocent in the case.
