In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
 All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of power, corruption, collusion and nepotism.
 The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
