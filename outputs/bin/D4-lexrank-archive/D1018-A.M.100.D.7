Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Ala., High School with 124 other students and seven chaperons when she vanished during the early hours of May 30 . Her passport and packed bags were found in her room . She was last seen by friends leaving the Oranjestad nightclub Carlos 'N Charlie's with Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers.
 The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.
