Defense lawyers are expected to try to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors that the hermit is the same man who placed or mailed bombs that killed Sacramento computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985, and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray 10 years later.
 Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year . The UNABOMber was so named because his early targets were universities and airlines.
