President Roh Moo-hyun ordered an investigation into wiretapping last month after a scandal broke over a recording of an alleged conversation in 1997 between a major newspaper publisher and an influential company executive . The two allegedly discussed channeling slush funds to candidates in that year's presidential election.
 A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
