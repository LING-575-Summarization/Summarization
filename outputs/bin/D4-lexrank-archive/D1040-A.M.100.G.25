Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime.
 M. Gerald Schwartzbach called 38 witnesses to emphasize the lack of evidence directly linking his client to the 2001 murder of Bonny Lee Bakley, and to attack the competence of the Los Angeles Police Department investigation, which focused early on the accused.
