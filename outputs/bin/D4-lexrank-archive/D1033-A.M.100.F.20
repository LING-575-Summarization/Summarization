South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
 Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States . Samsung apologized to the nation, expressing regret that "social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the Korean people" over the report of the tape.
