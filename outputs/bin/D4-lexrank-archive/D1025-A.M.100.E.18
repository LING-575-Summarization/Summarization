The 5-year-old male was the first of 19 grizzly bears to die in the region surrounding Yellowstone National Park and one of 50 killed in the lower 48 states, making 2004 the worst year for grizzly mortality since the animal was added to the endangered species list in 1975.
 The death rate here, where the grizzly population is estimated at 600, was 2 1/2 half times greater than the 15-year average . Most worrying to wildlife biologists was the fact that females made up 60 percent of the dead.
