A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17--the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
 Bearman said the group also was told that Holloway's friends had seen the same teenager in the casino at the hotel where they were staying.
