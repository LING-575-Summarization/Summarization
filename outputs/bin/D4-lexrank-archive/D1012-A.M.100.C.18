Less than an hour later, Helios Airways Flight 522 bound for Athens slammed into the side of a wooded Greek hill Sunday, killing all 121 people aboard . About one-third of the dead were children.

It suggests multiple malfunctions that happened either too quickly or too subtly for the pilots to be aware of them or to act in time to remedy them, aviation experts said.
