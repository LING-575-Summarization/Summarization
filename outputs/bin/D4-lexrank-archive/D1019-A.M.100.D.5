The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
 Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said a special team has been set up by the police to rescue the hostages who were taken in boats by the pirates.
 Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
