The soccer federation, which permits headgear but does not endorse it, fears that its wide use would undermine the assertion that soccer is a safe alternative to football, Skeen said . He likens the doubt of soccer officials to familiar but failed arguments once made against the use of bicycle helmets, automobile seat belts and soccer shin guards.
 The headgear debate is occurring at a time when some studies indicate that concussions occur in soccer at a rate similar to football.
 Not all medical soccer experts oppose headgear.
