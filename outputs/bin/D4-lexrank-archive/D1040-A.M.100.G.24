Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.
 Samuels cited testimony that Blake tried to have Bakley arrested and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her . After their marriage in November 2000, Blake solicited two Hollywood stuntmen to kill her.
 But Samuels said no one saw Blake return to the restaurant.
