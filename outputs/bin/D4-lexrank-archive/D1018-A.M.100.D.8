Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Alabama, High School with 124 other students and seven chaperones when she vanished during the early hours of May 30 . Her U.S. passport and packed bags were found in her room.
 The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.
