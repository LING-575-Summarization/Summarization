KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.
 The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.
 Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.
