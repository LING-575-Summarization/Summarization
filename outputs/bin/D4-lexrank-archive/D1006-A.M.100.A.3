Merck Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people who used it for longer than 18 months.
 Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx was pulled from the market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke . But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
 On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review all drugs of this type.
