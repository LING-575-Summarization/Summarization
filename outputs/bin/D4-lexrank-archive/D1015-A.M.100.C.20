Regional ecological protection programs have also been launched to reduce the deterioration of the ecological environment . The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
 Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical rain trees.
