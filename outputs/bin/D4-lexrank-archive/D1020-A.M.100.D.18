IBP, the world's largest processor of fresh beef, said in a report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.
 But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef produced on that day and the company said it had notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which was testing the product.
 Earlier this year, IBP recalled a shipment of 282,129 pounds of beef after a sample was found to be tainted by the same bacteria.
