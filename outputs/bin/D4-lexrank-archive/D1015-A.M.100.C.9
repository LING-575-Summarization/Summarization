Cui Xiaosu, an official in charge of the implementation of the project, said that the theme of the project will focus on environmental protection and help the poor in the project area.
 China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
 A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
