 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor . They said the next eruption was imminent or in progress, and could threaten life and property in the remote area near the volcano.
 Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
