Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street . His alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested shortly after the attack.
 After the film was shown on Dutch television in August, Van Gogh received death threats and police stepped up measures to protect him, much against his will.
 Van Gogh made many enemies within the Dutch Muslim community with his often-insulting descriptions of Islam.
