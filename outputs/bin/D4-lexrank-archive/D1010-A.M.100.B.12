The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
 A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
 No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
