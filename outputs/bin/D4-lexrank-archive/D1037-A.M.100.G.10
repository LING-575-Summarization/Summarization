In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases . The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.
 The managed reserve method is "the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease," said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
