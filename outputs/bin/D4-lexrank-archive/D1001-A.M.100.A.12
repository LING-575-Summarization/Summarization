Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
 The school's marquee proclaimed "Rebels our thoughts are with you ." Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded . Columbine is about three miles away.
