Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
 However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's wealth . It said it would be more relevant if the call for the probe into the riches of the former president and his family was made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.
