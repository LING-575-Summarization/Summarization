The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline--many for unknown reasons.
 The first vertebrate species to begin hopping and crawling on land 350 million years ago may be the first to die out, according to a study released Thursday that found a third of all amphibian species worldwide are threatened with extinction.
