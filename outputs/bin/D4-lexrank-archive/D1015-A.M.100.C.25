Northwest China's Yunnan Province has launched a project to strengthen environmental protection, and will pour more investment into the sector.
 Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
 Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
 Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says.
