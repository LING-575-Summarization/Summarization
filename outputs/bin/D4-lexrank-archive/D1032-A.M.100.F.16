More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
 Hetland could not say when production was expected to resume.
 Norway is the third crude exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and produces nearly three million barrels per day.
 A team of about 30 workers was tackling the problem.
 No injuries were reported.
