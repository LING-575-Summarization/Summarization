Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.
 A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17--the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
