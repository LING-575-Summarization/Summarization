It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
 Medical tests on a young Irishman have confirmed that he is suffering from variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, a Dublin hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.
 No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
