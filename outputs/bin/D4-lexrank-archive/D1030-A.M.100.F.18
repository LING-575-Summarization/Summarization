The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a shrublike plant grown widely in Asia . It can be found in more than 200 diet supplements, in pills and powders, drinks and diet bars, for sale in health food stores and on the Internet.
 Critics and proponents alike agree on one thing: ephedra is flying off the shelves . Metabolife International Inc., a 5-year-old San Diego company that sells an ephedra-based pill called Metabolife 356, says this year's sales will reach $900 million.
