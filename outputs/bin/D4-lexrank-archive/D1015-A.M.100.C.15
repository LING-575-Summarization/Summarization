Regional ecological protection programs have also been launched to reduce the deterioration of the ecological environment . The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
 Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China . The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
