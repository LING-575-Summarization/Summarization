Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea.
 Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
 Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the IWC.
