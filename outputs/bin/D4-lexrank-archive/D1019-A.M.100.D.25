Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
 The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The Associated Press by telephone.
 Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared with Indonesia.
