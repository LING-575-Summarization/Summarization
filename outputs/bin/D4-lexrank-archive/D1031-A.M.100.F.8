 In the Maldives, dive operator Norbert Schmidt said the eastern part of the island was hit the worst, with dead coral and sand covering the runway at Hulule International Airport .

 And in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby salmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.
