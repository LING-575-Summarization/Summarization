South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
 Yonhap news agency said prosecutors would summon Lee Hak-Soo, a powerful vice chairman of Samsung, early next week to question him over the wiretapping and allegations that Samsung provided illicit campaign funds to politicians.
