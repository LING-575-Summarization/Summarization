The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
 Sheriff John Stone said Tuesday afternoon that there could be as many as 25 dead . By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death toll was 15, including the two gunmen.
 "There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were constantly getting different counts," Davis said.
