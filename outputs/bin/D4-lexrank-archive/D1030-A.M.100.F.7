 The new law took dietary supplements out of the underground and into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs, even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy . If the products were safe, companies could say what they wished, so long as they did not claim their products could prevent, treat or cure disease . Thus, McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin "promotes healthy cholesterol," but not that it "prevents heart attack or stroke."
