Yunnan also has decided to strengthen environmental protection of its lake areas, which are the main residential areas there, by working out many restrictions for the use of lake resources . It has already succeeded in improving the water quality of the Dianchi Lake and Nanpanjiang River.

 Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says.
 Now there are only 15 to 20 gibbons remaining in the mountain area.
