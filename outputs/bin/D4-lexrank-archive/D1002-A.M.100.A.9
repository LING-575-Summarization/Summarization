A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting, Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury voted on the charges last Thursday . Asked if the timing of the arraignment was scheduled to accommodate the Diallo family's travel plans, Reed said he would not comment.
 The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury.
 "We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial," Safir said.
