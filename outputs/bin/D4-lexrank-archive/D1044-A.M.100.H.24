Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
 Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
 Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
