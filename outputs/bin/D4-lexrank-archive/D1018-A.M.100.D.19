The two brothers have told police that they and Joran were with Holloway and that she and the Dutch youth were petting in the back seat of their car . The detainees initially said they took Holloway to a beach on the northern part of the island then dropped her off at her Holiday Inn hotel, where they claimed she was approached by a security guard.
 Bearman said the group also was told that Holloway's friends had seen the same teenager in the casino at the hotel where they were staying.
