Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
 The office of Indonesia's attorney general has formed a team to investigate the wealth of present and former Indonesian government officials, a spokesman of the office said here Tuesday.
 American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.
