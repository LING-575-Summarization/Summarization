Pfc . Lynndie R. England, the 22-year-old woman who became an infamous presence in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse photographs, pleaded guilty on Monday to seven of the nine counts against her, under an agreement with military prosecutors.
 Two people close to the prosecution have said England can expect to receive no more than 30 months in prison.
 Before accepting England's plea, Pohl carefully scrutinized the charges and the actions of the 22-year-old Army reservist.
