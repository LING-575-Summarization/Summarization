The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
 The death toll from the avian flu remained unchanged on Thursday at four, including the death of a 60-year-old man, who was suspected of being infected with the virus, according to the DH daily update on the influenza.
