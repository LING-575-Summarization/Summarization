A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons . He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons . He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.
 The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.
