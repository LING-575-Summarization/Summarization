With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by the continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest deadly slide was scarce . Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in by helicopter.
