"This was a relatively small eruption," said John Major, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey . He said USGS observers near the volcano reported that no molten rock flowed from the point in the mountain's lava dome where the steam vented.
 After the 1980 eruption, a lahar traveled 50 miles from Mount St. Helens, ripping out bridges and destroying homes.
 In comparison, Friday's eruption was a "hiccup," USGS geologist Tom Pierson told reporters.
