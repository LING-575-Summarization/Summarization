Smit reviewed police reports on the case for 18 months for the Boulder County prosecutor's office . "The `case' tells me that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter, that a very dangerous killer is still out there and no one is actively looking for him," Smit said in his letter.
 Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
