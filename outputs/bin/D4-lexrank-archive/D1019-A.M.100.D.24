About 20 people, including foreign tourists, were taken hostage by armed pirates on Sipadan island off the Sabah coast, East Malaysia, Sunday night, according to police sources Monday.
 Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
 A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track down the kidnappers.
 Malaysian officials said today that the kidnappers were believed to be outside Malaysian waters.
