Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
 Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
