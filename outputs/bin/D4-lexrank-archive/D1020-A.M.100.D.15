Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, said that on Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators isolated this strain of Listeria on an open package of hot dogs that a month earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill . It is not known how or where this package was contaminated.
