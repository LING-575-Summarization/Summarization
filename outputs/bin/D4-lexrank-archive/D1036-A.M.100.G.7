Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
 Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.
