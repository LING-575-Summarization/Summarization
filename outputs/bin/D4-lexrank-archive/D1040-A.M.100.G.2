The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley . Other witnesses spoke of his anxiety when he found out Bakley was pregnant and his desire to get her out of his life but to keep the baby that he loved.
 Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined . Blake could face life in prison if convicted.
