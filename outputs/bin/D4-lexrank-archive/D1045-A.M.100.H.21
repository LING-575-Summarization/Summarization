The Jilin and Heilongjiang provincial governments have activated their contingency programs for environmental incidents, and have taken measures to ensure the safety of potable water, said the official.
 Songhua River will carry poisonous substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
 He said the pollutant strip will flow out of Harbin Saturday morning.
 The river is the main source of drinking water supply to Harbin, a city of more than 3 million people.
