Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity defense . A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was sane when she had sex with the boy . But several psychiatrists have since evaluated her and several, Fitzgibbons said, determined that trauma she suffered after she was raped at 13 and her subsequent mental illness may have led her to actions.
 After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
