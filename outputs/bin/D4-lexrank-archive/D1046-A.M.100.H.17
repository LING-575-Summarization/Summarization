The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane headed for Medan, the main city on Indonesia's Sumatra island, one of the areas hardest hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami, the ministry said in a statement.
 Sumatra is the focus of a massive international aid effort, with foreign militaries led by the United States flying in assistance since the magnitude 9.0 quake struck on Dec. 26.
 The ambassador said that his government would conduct a survey this week in Aceh province in order to find out what is the most needed for survivors in the tsunami-hit areas.
