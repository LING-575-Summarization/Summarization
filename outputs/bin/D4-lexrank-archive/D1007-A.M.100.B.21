Hong Kong health authorities are stepping up the hunt for the source of a deadly influenza strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global alert.
 Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that it could have been passed to humans by chickens.
 All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu.
 Another victim, a two-year-old boy, who was hospitalized with fever in November, later fully recovered.
