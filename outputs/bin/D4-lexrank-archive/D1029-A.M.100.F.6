Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation.
 Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui . Clashes between troops and tribesmen demanding more returns from the natural resources extracted on their territory are common . Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
