However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's wealth . It said it would be more relevant if the call for the probe into the riches of the former president and his family was made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.
 The government prosecutor's office would continue a thorough investigation into the wealth while the land would be seized for the state or returned to its original owners, Hasan said.
