The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species . The three-year, $1.5 million study, which involved more than 500 scientists from more than 60 countries, is being published Friday in the journal Science.
 Similar evaluations of birds and mammals found smaller percentages at risk--23 percent for mammals and 12 percent for birds.
 About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
