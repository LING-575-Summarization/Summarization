What has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the earthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the surface . That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising from the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and eruptions is left over from six years ago . Then, as now, a swarm of earthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose upward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an eruption.
