Pfizer says there is no evidence that its drugs have problems similar to Vioxx because they are chemically different . Although Bextra is not approved for use for surgery patients, Pfizer said that its studies had shown that general surgery patients--as opposed to bypass patients--were not at higher risk for heart attacks.
 Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
