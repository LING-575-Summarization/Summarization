Herbal supplements are regulated by a looser set of standards . Before the passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, manufacturers were prohibited, for instance, from making claims about the potential benefits of their products . But the revised guidelines allow companies to advertise the health effects of herbal supplements _ without having to conclusively prove their effectiveness _ so long as the wording does not suggest that the products prevent, treat or cure disease.
