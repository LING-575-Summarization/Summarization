President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
 Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
 Ruling and opposition party lawmakers have urged Hong to step down, but Roh did not comment on his fate, the spokesman said.
