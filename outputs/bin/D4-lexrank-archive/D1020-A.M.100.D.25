Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua)--A U.S. company said Wednesday that it was recalling all ground beef it produced on October 22 because it may contain the potentially deadly E.coli O157: H7 bacteria.
 IBP, the world's largest processor of fresh beef, said in a report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.
 Earlier this year, IBP recalled a shipment of 282,129 pounds of beef after a sample was found to be tainted by the same bacteria.
