The Veterans Administration must review all benefit claims denied to hundreds of Vietnam veterans who failed to say their illnesses resulted from exposure to Agent Orange, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
 The federal government has paid some benefits to about 6,000 Vietnam veterans who developed cancer and other illnesses.
 But an estimated 1,000 veterans were denied back payments under strict language that required applicants to state that Agent Orange or herbicides were linked to the cause of the disability or death, a hurdle ruled illegal Thursday in the class-action lawsuit.
