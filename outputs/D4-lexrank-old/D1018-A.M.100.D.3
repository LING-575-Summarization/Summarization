Investigators towed two vehicles from the property, a blue SUV and a red Jeep, and removed garbage bags of items while media trained cameras on the modest, one-story yellow stucco home.
 Also at Wednesday's hearing, defense attorneys filed motions to see the evidence warranting the continued incarceration of their clients, and prosecutors sought the removal of lawyer Antonio Carlo, who is representing Joran Van Der Sloot.
 The judge did not immediately rule on the motions.
