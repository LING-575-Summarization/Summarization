At least eight others were also killed, including some of Hariri's bodyguards.
 The explosion, apparently caused by a car bomb, occurred around 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), when Hariri's motorcade of four black limousines escorted by jeeps was passing by in the seafront area of the capital.
 Security forces sealed off the scene, where a big crater was gouged by the explosion.
 It appeared to be the biggest bomb in the city since Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990.
