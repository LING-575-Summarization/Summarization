The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C.
 The secretary-general of the National Commission on Human Rights, Baharuddin Lopa, said yesterday that Soeharto must be prosecuted if there is adequate evidence to prove his wrongdoing.
 The offices of the attorney general, chief public prosecutor and public prosecutor have asked the public to provide information about the wealth of officials to help the team in its investigations, the spokesman said.
