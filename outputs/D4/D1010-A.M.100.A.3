The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
 The federal government is increasing the number of cattle tested to 30,000 in 2005 and subsequent years.
 The testing process is aimed at high-risk cattle that are showing signs of disease, such as aged or downer animals.
