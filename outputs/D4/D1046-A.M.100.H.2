The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane headed for Medan, the main city on Indonesia's Sumatra island, one of the areas hardest hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami, the ministry said in a statement.
 The official news agency BSS Monday quoted the sources at the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation as saying that the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) would airlift a part of the food to Sumatra immediately after availability of aircraft and that the rest would be shipped for Sri Lanka in the next couple of days.
