A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
Reports said that crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers on entry.
Greek government spokesman Roussopoulos said the pilots sent to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there may have been a last-gasp effort by two others on the plane to bring the craft back under control.
