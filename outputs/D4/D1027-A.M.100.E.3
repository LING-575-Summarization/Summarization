(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed. 
 Judge Jeffrey Donnell moved the start of the trial for Russell Arthur Henderson from March 22 to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys.
