Howard said the catching of humpback whales, which migrate the west and east coasts of Australia in increasing numbers, "is something that will potentially seriously damage the way Australians perceive Japan." 
 New Zealand is seeking all options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday. 
 Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
