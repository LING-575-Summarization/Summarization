The Ugandan police has warned to enforce strict traffic regulations beginning from Tuesday, saying that passengers who will travel in vehicles without wearing safety belts will be arrested.
According to the traffic regulations, passengers in public and private vehicles will face arrest and up to one month in jail or an on-spot fine of 20,000 shillings (11.6 US dollars) if they travel without fastening their safety belts.
Though many people who skateboard said they could understand the need for safety in their sport, some wondered if it the law went too far.
