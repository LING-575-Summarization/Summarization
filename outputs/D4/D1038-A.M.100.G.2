Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor . They said the next eruption was imminent or in progress, and could threaten life and property in the remote area near the volcano.
 "This was a relatively small eruption," said John Major, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey . He said USGS observers near the volcano reported that no molten rock flowed from the point in the mountain's lava dome where the steam vented.
