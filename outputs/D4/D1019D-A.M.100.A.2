The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
 A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track down the kidnappers.
