The St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, one of the Cheseapeake Bay's largest celebrations, is being held this weekend, Oct. 16-17, at the fairgrounds in Leonardtown, Md.
 The key issue in the legal action to be filed Wednesday is nitrogen, which along with phosphorus serves as food for huge algae blooms in the bay . Scientists blame these algae for creating "bad water" where fish and crabs cannot breathe.
