The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
 The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a large consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce made by Premier Foods.
 The sauce was then added as an ingredient to at least 359 products made by supermarkets and leading food companies such as Unilever.
