President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
 A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
 Television and newspapers have released what they called a taped private conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate Samsung in 1997.
