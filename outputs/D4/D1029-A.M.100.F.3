Investigators suspect rebel tribesmen may have been involved in the weekend bombing of a religious shrine in Pakistan's restive southwest that killed 39 people, police said Monday. 
 Police have largely ruled out sectarian rivalry and say Saturday's attack on the holy site may be linked to bloody clashes two days earlier between government forces and nationalist clans in the unruly province of Baluchistan.
