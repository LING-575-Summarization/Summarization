A previously unknown Islamic group on Monday claimed responsibility for an earlier killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri due to his ties with Saudi Arabia, the Qatar-based al-Jazeera TV channel reported.
On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
