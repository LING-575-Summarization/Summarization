The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day . The platform processes another 75,000 barrels a day in production from the nearby Vigdis field, but it wasn't clear if that oil was being routed to another platform.
 The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the leaking injection well.
