The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year. 
 The money would come from the euro188 million (US$235 million) set aside in 2005 to combat animal diseases in the EU.
