The meat was under test by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . But the company decided Wednesday to recall it.
 The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced.
 The problem was discovered in a routine Food and Drug Administration review of supermarket shelves.
