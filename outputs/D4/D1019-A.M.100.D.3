On March 2, gunmen from the al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf group kidnapped 21 people from a luxury resort in Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island. 
 The hostages were taken to the southern Philippines, where they were taken to two boats. 
 The gunmen then forced their captives to swim to two fishing boats, which sped away and appeared to be heading toward Philippine waters.
