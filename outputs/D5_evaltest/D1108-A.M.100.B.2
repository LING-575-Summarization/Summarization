Thousands of people in the path of a cyclone were evacuated from coastal areas as forecasters warned the storm could hit land in Bangladesh or neighbouring India later Thursday.
Hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were left homeless after a powerful cyclone smashed impoverished Bangladesh with huge waves, severe winds and torrential rains in Bangladesh, officials said Friday.
The cyclone hit the southwestern coast of Bangladesh on Thursday before sweeping north to the capital Dhaka, destroying out homes and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee for their lives.
