Thirty-two people were killed and at least 15 injured in two shooting attacks at Virginia Tech on Monday during three hours of horror and chaos on this sprawling southwestern Virginia campus. 
 The Virginia Tech attacks started early in the morning, with a call to police at 7:15 from West Ambler Johnston Hall, a 900-student freshman dormitory, as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way to them.
