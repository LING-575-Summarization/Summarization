The official, Dr. Charles J. Ganley, director of the office of nonprescription drug products at the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview that the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children" and that "we're particularly concerned about the use of these drugs in children less than 2 years of age."
Federal drug regulators have started a broad review of the safety of popular cough and cold remedies meant for children, a top official said Thursday.
