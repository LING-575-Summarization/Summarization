Walter Simpson was arrested on robbery charges in Las Vegas Sunday, three days after police began an investigation into a casino theft involving the well-known sports celebrity. 
 Simpson, 60, was put into police custody soon before noon on charges in relation to an armed robbery of sport memorabilia in a Las Vegas casino and hotel Thursday, police said. 
 An earlier report said that his accuser, a California sport memorabilia collector, was not interested in pursuing the case against the former NFL star anymore.
