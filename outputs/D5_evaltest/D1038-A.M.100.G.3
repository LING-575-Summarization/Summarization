Hospitals in Canada's biggest cities, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto confirmed "a substantial number" of Canadians had traveled to China for suspicious organ transplants. 
 They also urged countries to post travel advisories warning that organs from China may have been harvested from unwilling donors; asked states to cease offering follow-up care to patients who had shady organ transplants in China; and called on foreign doctors to cut ties with their Chinese counterparts suspected of such practices.
