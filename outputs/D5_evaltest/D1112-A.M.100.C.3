Juan Alvarez parked his SUV on railroad tracks, causing a Metrolink train to derail and strike another Metrolink train going the other direction on Jan. 26, 2005. 
 He was convicted of 11 counts of first-degree murder and faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
 Prosecutors argued that Alvarez ripped apart the lives of families whose loved ones were killed in the derailment and that he had forefeited his right to live. 
 Defense argued that Alvarez's childhood of abuse by a father who was a "monster" and a mother who tried to abort him shaped him into a mentally disturbed man who sought refuge in methamphetamine addiction.
