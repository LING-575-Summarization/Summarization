The Three Gorges Dam in central China's Hubei Province Thursday has opened its floodgates to ease the severe water shortages along China's longest waterway.
China's central and western regions will suffer an annual water shortage of about 20 billion cubic meters from 2010 to 2030, an official report evaluating climate change said.
Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, over the last two weeks, leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages, local water authorities said on Monday.
