Soil erosion affects up to 73,200 square kilometers of the land Guizhou -- 41 percent of its total land area -- but around 25,000 square kilometers have been brought under control along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River in the past few years, he said. 
 At the current rate at which damaged areas are being recovered -- 1,000 square kilometers per year -- Guizhou would need at least 70 years to bring soil erosion under control, he added.
