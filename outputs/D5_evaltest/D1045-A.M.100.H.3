China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches. 
 A spokesman for the Heilongjiang provincial government said that the poisonous organic substances, mainly high-density benzene and nitrobenzene flowing down the Songhua River, will arrive in this provincial capital early Thursday.
