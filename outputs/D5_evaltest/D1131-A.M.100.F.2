The idea is to grow coral in labs, kind of like fish farms, so they can be returned to their natural settings in Florida's struggling coral reefs.
"Red coral is the most valuable and widely traded out of all the coral species, and CITES protection will help ensure the future of the species and the red coral industry," he said.
The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.
They monitored the different species of brain coral, boulder coral and others.
