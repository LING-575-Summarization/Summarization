Britain's senior police officer said here on Saturday night that the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to events in London where two car bombs were defused on Friday.
Glasgow Airport was evacuated and closed after a burning car crashed into the main terminal building on Saturday afternoon.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the security threat level to "critical".
