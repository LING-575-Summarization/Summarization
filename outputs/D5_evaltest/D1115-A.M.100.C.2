The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest, according to the Coast Guard and the Maritime Ministry.
A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels, of crude oil off South Korea's stormy west coast on Friday, officials said, in what was estimated to be the nation's largest maritime oil spill.
The tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of crude oil.
Friday's accident is the largest offshore oil spill in South Korea.
