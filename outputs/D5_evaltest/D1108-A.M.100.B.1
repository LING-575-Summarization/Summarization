Officials in both Bangladesh and across the border in India -- which is also expecting highly destructive winds and torrential rains -- have been racing to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the coast over the past 48 hours.
Hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were left homeless after a powerful cyclone smashed impoverished Bangladesh with huge waves, severe winds and torrential rains in Bangladesh, officials said Friday.
