Officials in both Bangladesh and across Bangladesh's border with India's in India--which is also expecting highly destructive winds and torrential rains--have been racing to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from Bangladesh's southwestern coast over the past 48 hours.
Hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were left homeless after the storm--visible from space as a huge swirling white mass that moved north from the Bay of Bengal--smashed low-lying Bangladesh--one of the world's poorest countries with huge waves, severe winds and torrential rains in the country, officials said Friday.
