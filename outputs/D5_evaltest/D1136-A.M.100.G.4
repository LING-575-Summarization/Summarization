BEIJING, Jan. 3 (Xinhua)
Rising temperatures may pose a challenge to the long-term food security of China, the world's most populous country, according to an official report evaluating climate change.
China's output of major crops, including rice, wheat and corn, could fall by up to 37 percent in the second half of this century if no effective measures are taken to curb greenhouse gases in the coming 20 to 50 years, according to the report.
