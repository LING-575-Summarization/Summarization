Kenya and Mali's have proposed a complete ban on the overall trade in elephant tusks or finished ivory products for two decades for consideration at the conference in The Hague, The UN agency regulating the trade in endangered species said.
An international effort to halt the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks has all but collapsed in most of the whole continent, leaving officials and advocates alarmed about the survival of the giant beasts.
Because of this, the African elephant is classed as "vulnerable" and trade in ivory has been banned since 1989 to try to combat poaching.
