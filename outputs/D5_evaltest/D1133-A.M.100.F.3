British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident in which a jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the security threat level to "critical" 
 Brown praised the emergency services for their response to foiling two car bomb attacks in London Friday and "now today the attack in Glasgow." 
 Until Brown spoke, there had been no official confirmation that the incident in Glasgow Saturday afternoon was being treated as a deliberate attack.
