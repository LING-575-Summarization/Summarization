A British security official, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said the heightened level reflected an assessment that the London and Glasgow attacks were "linked in some ways and, therefore, there are clearly individuals who have the capability and intent to carry out further attacks." 
 The links related to the way the foiled car-bomb attacks in London and the airport attack in Glasgow had been conceived and planned using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.
