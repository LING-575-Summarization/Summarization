Three years ago Saturday, Steven Toby settled down for a quick nap and woke up in a nightmare.
The 51-year-old Shadow Hills man was headed south on Metrolink 100, catching a little shut-eye on his way to his job at Los Angeles City Hall.
The clock read 6:02 a.m. A tremendous collision jarred him awake.
The lights went out and Toby heard a mass gasp.
His train had gone off the rails.
