Sclavos said VeriSign, which operates two of the 13 so-called "root" servers that manage global Internet traffic, has an obligation to stay ahead of increasingly insidious and widespread Internet attacks.
In October 2002, another major attack targeted the 13 root servers and slowed traffic.
Among the targeted "root" servers that manage global Internet traffic were ones operated by the Defense Department and the Internet's primary oversight body.
The Homeland Security Department confirmed it was monitoring what it called "anomalous" Internet traffic.
