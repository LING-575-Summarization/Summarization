Last December , Kempthorne proposed designating polar bears as a `` threatened '' species deserving of federal protection under the Endangered Species Act , because of melting Arctic sea ice from global warming .If the polar bear were listed as a threatened species , all federal agencies would have to ensure that anything they authorize that might affect polar bears will not jeopardize their survival or the sea ice where they live .Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming .
