Only about 20 turtles were still alive.
There are seven sea turtle species in the world.
"Of the 185 Green turtles and the 89 Hawksbill turtles, 32 are still alive and we are going to release them very soon," said Mohamad Yusoff.
The World Conservation lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.
The 13 Chinese were part of an original group of 19 captured by marine police on March 26 with 47 Green turtles and 29 Hawksbill turtles.
