The US State Department said it was unaware of any international links to a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the US embassy in Athens early Friday which caused no injuries.
A rocket struck the U.S. Embassy early Friday, exploding inside the modern, glass-fronted building but causing no injuries in an attack that Greek authorities said was probably carried out by a domestic terrorist group.
Public Order Vyron Polydoras said police were examining two claims of responsibility for Friday's attack by a new group called Revolutionary Struggle, which first appeared in 2003.
