Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
Treating genital herpes can also help keep the AIDS virus under control in women with both infections, and might reduce the spread of HIV as well, the first major study to test this strategy suggests.
The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda were halted ahead of schedule, for it would have been ethically wrong to continue them.
