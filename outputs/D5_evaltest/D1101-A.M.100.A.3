In the aftermath of the West Nickel Mines Amish School shooting, the Amish have reached out to the family of the gunman, Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, who committed suicide during the attack. 
 Roberts left a note saying he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago and dreamed of molesting again. 
 There was no evidence that he planned to sexually assault the girls. 
 Amish leaders are considering tearing down the one-room school and replacing it with a community center.
