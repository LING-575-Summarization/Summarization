Sun Xianze, director of the SFDA's food safety coordination department, told a national food safety conference in Beijing on Friday that 12 evaluation teams composed of officials from SFDA and other governmental departments including the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Health, will set off for the country's four municipalities and 27 provincial or regional capital cities this weekend. 
 Sun said the 2006 food safety evaluation campaign will cover three major indices -- urban government performance, consumer satisfaction and food safety inspection.
