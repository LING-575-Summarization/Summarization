Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described the shooting, the worst in the Nordic country's history, as "a great tragedy." 
 The rampage, which began at 11:43 am (0943 GMT) inside a classroom at the secondary school of some 450 pupils, came after Auvinen posted a video entitled "Jokela High School Massacre -- 11/7/2007" on file-sharing website YouTube.
