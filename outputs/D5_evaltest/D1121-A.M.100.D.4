Michael Vick was due in federal court Thursday to start a legal process that jeopardizes not only his career, but also his freedom.
The Atlanta Falcons quarterback was expected to appear at a bond hearing and enter a plea on dogfighting conspiracy charges.
Vick is accused with three others of conspiracy involving competitive dogfighting, procuring and training pit bulls for fighting, and conducting the enterprise across state lines.
