A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels, of crude oil off South Korea's stormy west coast on Friday, officials said, in what was estimated to be the nation's largest maritime oil spill. 
 The spill occurred when a vessel carrying a crane crashed into the 147,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit on Friday morning about 5 nautical miles off the coast near Taean, 90 miles southwest of Seoul.
