The breast cancer study, published online in the current issue of the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, found that individuals with the highest blood levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, had the lowest risk of breast cancer. 
 The researchers divided the 1,760 records of individuals into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels of 25(OH)D (less than 13 nanograms per milliliter, or 13 ng/ml) to the highest ( approximately 52 ng/ml). 
 "The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased," said study co- author Cedric Garland, Dr.P.H. 
 "The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun." 
 The colorectal cancer study, published online February 6 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is a meta-analysis of five studies that explored the association of blood levels of 25(OH)D with risk of colon cancer.
