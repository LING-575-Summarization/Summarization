An Israeli woman was killed and 11 others were wounded in the suicide bombing at a shopping mall in southern Israel town of Dimona, the first of its kind on the Israeli soil in more than one year.
Two Palestinian suicide bombers attempted to carry out a twin bombing attack in a busy commercial center of southern Israeli town of Dimona.
Stressing that the suicide bombers entered Israel from Gaza, the spokesman said the Israeli claims that they crossed from Sinai was meant at "exporting Israel's crisis to Egypt."
