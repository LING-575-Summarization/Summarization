The drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade ago were under water. 
 Scientists predict that climate change will worsen Western drought patterns and reduce Colorado flows by increasing evaporation and decreasing snowfall. 
 California, which has the biggest water allocation and seniority rights in the Lower Basin, would not be affected. 
 Arizona, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower Basin, plans to hold water in Mead from fallowed farmland along the Virgin and Muddy rivers. 
 Nevada, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower Basin, plans to hold water in Drop Two, near the Mexican border, to capture flows ordered by U.S. farmers who don't use it during rain.
