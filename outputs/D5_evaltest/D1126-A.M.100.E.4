Bush wiped the mess off with his bare hand.
It happened midway through his news conference in the Rose Garden Thursday morning, in between his 10th and 11th mentions of al- Qaida: A bird flew over the president and deposited a wet, white dropping on the upper left sleeve of his jacket.
There was no evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible for this particular attack, and--who knows?
