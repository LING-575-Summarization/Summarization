The recall of nearly a million toys from Mattel Inc.'s Fisher-Price unit because of possible lead paint was the largest in the company's history. 
 The company said it was working to understand how the problem happened at a subcontractor's plant in China. 
 Mattel said it was able to stop two-thirds of the 967,000 toys recalled in the United States before they hit store shelves. 
 The company informed the Consumer Products Safety Commission of the need for a recall on July 26. 
 Mattel said it did not know how many consumers bought those toys, which were made between April 19 and July 6 and sold as early as May.
