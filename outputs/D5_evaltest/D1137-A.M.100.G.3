The accident happened on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue at about 2:20 p.m. at the construction site of a high-rise condominium. 
 About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.
