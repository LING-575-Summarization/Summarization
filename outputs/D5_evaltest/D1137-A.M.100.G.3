At least four people were killed when a construction crane toppled over a Manhattan street Saturday afternoon. 
 The accident occurred at the construction site of a 43-story high-rise building being built on the site of a four-story town house. 
 The town house was destroyed, and at least five other buildings were damaged. 
 Three people were listed as missing. 
 The city's Buildings Department issued 13 violations at the site in the past 27 months. 
 Investigators are looking at either mechanical failure or "perhaps human error" as a possible cause of the accident.
