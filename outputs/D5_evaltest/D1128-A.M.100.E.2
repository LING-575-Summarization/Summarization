Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people in Sierra Leone.
The defence of Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor, whose war crimes trial is set to start Monday, has "fully adequate resources," the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone said here Wednesday.
Earlier this week, the Special Court for Sierra Leone set June 4 as the start date for Taylor's trial, which is expected to take up to a year to complete.
