Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack. 
 Press Trust of India, which said 200 had been injured, quoted a statement from Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani saying his country, "condemns all acts of terrorism and reaffirms its firm commitment to fight this scourge together with the international community." 
 Police said seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other during the evening in crowded markets of old walled Jaipur, about 260 kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
