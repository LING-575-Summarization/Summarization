The toy maker RC2 Corp. pulled a number of its Thomas & amp; Friends trains and accessory parts off the shelves on Thursday after learning that the red and yellow paint used to decorate more than 1.5 million of the toys contained lead.
Lead, if ingested by children, can cause long-term neurological problems that affect learning and behavior.
"Parents should not delay in getting these toys away from their kids," Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said Thursday.
