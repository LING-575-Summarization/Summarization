The State Ethnic Affairs Commission decided on Tuesday to grant 2 million yuan (about 285,000 U.S. dollars) to its provincial branch in the southwestern Sichuan Province for disaster-relief work. 
 The funds will be used with a special focus on aiding ethnic minorities who have been affected by the earthquake.
