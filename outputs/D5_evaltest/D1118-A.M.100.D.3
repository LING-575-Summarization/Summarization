Robert Hawkins, 19, killed eight people and himself at a mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Wednesday. 
 He was a high school dropout with a criminal past. 
 He had a felony drug conviction in 2005 and a disorderly conduct charge seven months later. 
 He was due in court later this month on charges he contributed to the delinquency of a minor. 
 He left a suicide note saying he was sorry for everything and would not be a burden on his family anymore.
