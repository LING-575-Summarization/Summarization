At least 10 cats and dogs have died after eating recalled pet food made by Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario. 
 The FDA is focusing on contamination of wheat gluten, a protein used as filler in the foods' manufacture. 
 Menu Foods and the FDA said the timing of the illnesses coincided with a point at which the company started using a new wheat gluten supplier.
