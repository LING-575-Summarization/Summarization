Two Palestinian suicide bombers attacked an Israeli commercial center in Jerusalem on Saturday. 
 The first detonated his explosive belt, killing an Israeli woman and wounding 10 others, while the second was shot dead by Israeli police before he could set off his device. 
 The first bomber was identified as a member of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed wing of the Palestinian Fatah movement. 
 The group denied that the two bombers entered Israel via Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where the border fence with Gaza had been blown holes.
