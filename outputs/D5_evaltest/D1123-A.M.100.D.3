A rocket-propelled grenade struck the U.S. Embassy in Athens early Friday, causing limited damage and no injuries. 
 The attack revived fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups that carried out deadly strikes over three decades. 
 The embassy was struck shortly before 6 a.m. (0400GMT) and the blast shattered windows in nearby buildings. 
 The Pentagon received a report on the attack, but no request for any action. 
 A police task force to investigate the attack will be headed by a former counterterrorism chief who eradicated the far-left November 17 group in 2002.
