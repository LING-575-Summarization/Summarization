But police said it was Hawkins who went into an Omaha shopping mall on Wednesday and began a shooting rampage that killed eight people.
Fidler said he huddled in the corner of the men's clothing department with about a dozen other employees until police yelled to get out of the store.
Mickey Vickory, who worked in the store's third-floor service department, said she heard shots and went with co-workers and customers into a back closet, emerging about a half-hour later when police shouted to come out with their hands up.
