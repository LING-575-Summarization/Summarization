China increased its grain production 2.8 percent to 497.46 million tonnes in 2006, but the world's most populous nation still faces the prospect of shortages. 
 Production last year was 13.46 million tonnes more than in 2005, as annual grain output in China increased for the third year running, but still short of the country's demand.
