Police officials said they were not yet ready to identify the gunman or even say whether there was more than one in the attacks that wreaked devastation on this campus of 36,000 students, faculty members and staff.
Virginia Tech authorities and the police are investigating the identities of those killed as well as the gunman in the campus shooting rampage, a Virginia Tech spokeswoman told Xinhua on Monday.
The university community is urged to be cautious and are asked to contact Virginia Tech Police if you observe anything suspicious or with information on the case.
