A giant crane separated from the side of a skyscraper under construction and smashed into a block of residential buildings Saturday, killing at least two people on Manhattan's East Side.
At least one small, brick apartment building appeared to have been completely pulverized by the falling wreckage.

The crane, about 19 stories high, demolished parts of several buildings as it fell.
Fire Department officials said at least two people were dead, and several others were taken to two area hospitals.
