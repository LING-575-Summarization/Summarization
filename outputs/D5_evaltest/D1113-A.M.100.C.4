The arrest came as customs officials and police investigate 2,794 kilograms (3.07 U.S. tons) of ivory that was found in a cargo container last year at Osaka's South Port, said Toshiro Otsuka, an Osaka police official.
Police in western Japan arrested two brothers on Wednesday for allegedly trying to import nearly three tons of ivory, a violation under the international ban on the trade in elephant tusks.
This was the largest amount of ivory ever seized in Japan, Kyodo News agency said.
