But police said it was Hawkins who went into an Omaha shopping mall on Wednesday and began a shooting rampage that killed eight people.
When the shooting was over, Hawkins shot himself.
In the note, Maruca-Kovac said, Hawkins said "how sorry he was for everything."
He tried to help out all the time," Maruca-Kovac said.
Hawkins lived with the family for about a year.
About an hour before the shooting, Hawkins called her and told her he had written a suicide note, Maruca-Kovac said.
