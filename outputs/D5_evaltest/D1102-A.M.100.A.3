The Internet was designed to be open and flexible, and all users were assumed to be trustworthy. 
 Thus, the Internet's protocols were not designed to authenticate users and their data, allowing spammers and hackers to easily cover their tracks by attaching fake return addresses onto data packets. 
 Internet applications such as firewalls and spam filters attempt to control security threats. 
 But because such techniques do not penetrate deep into the network, bad data still get passed along, clogging systems and possibly fooling the filtering technology.
