Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Tuesday he was deeply concerned with the crash of a passenger plane and the sinking of a ferry in the last few days that might have killed hundreds of people.
Earlier on Friday, a ferry carrying 628 people sank off the Java coast with some 400 passengers reported missing.
A Boeing 737-400 plane with 102 people onboard crashed into a mountain in the West Sulawesi province Monday, killing at least 90 people.
