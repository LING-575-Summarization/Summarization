Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced an independent review of conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Naval Medical Center in Maryland. 
 The review will be conducted by two former Army secretaries, Togo West and Jack Marsh. 
 Gates said some people have been relieved of duty, but no one has offered to resign. 
 The Army is also conducting its own review of what happened at Walter Reed.
