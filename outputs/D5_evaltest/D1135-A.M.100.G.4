The implosion of a Wall Street firm whose owner is accused in a $50 billion swindle left regulators scrambling to seize control of its assets Friday as dozens of investors worried that they had gone from rich to poor overnight.
The collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's company came just hours before his arrest Thursday on a single securities fraud count.
Madoff, who allegedly told his employees he was running a "giant (pyramid) scheme," was freed on $10 million bail.
