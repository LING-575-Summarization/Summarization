The "Senopati Nusantara" (Archipelago Commander) was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to Semarang when it sank late Friday with some 600 people on board. 
 More than 200 survivors have been found and seven people have been found dead. 
 The death toll is expected to rise as the search continues.
