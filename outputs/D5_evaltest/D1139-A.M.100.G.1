The U.S. Navy said a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude oil hundreds of miles (kilometers) off the coast of East Africa was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that Somali pirates were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
Pirates have been spreading their attacks in recent weeks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, maritime security experts said.
