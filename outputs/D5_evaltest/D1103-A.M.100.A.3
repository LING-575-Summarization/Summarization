On March 11, 2004, four bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and injuring more than 1,800. 
 Prosecutors say the attacks were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al-Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq. 
 One of the alleged masterminds, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias "Mohammed the Egyptian," rejected all charges against him and refused to give evidence. 
 He is one of seven defendants facing sentences of some 40,000 years each for the deaths and membership of a terrorist organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term anyone can actually serve is 40 years.
