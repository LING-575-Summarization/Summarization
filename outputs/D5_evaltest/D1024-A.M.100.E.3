An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family. 
 "It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake," he said, referring to the May 27 quake near the ancient city of Yogyakarta which killed around 6,000 people.
