The government's flood forecasting and warning centre said the situation could worsen in the next few days as major monsoon and Himalayan-glacier fed rivers -- the Ganges and the Brahmaputra that flow through Bangladesh -- are expected to crest. 
 This situation is most likely to deteriorate as the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) reported on Sunday that water flow in the major rivers, which are already flowing above danger levels, may rise further in the next few days.
