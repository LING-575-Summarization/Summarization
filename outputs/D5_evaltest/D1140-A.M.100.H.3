More than a third of Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 145 million people, has been inundated by floods. 
 At least 5 million people have either been marooned or displaced in the country's hardest-hit northern region. 
 Bangladesh is hammered by monsoon floods that kill hundreds every year and destroy homes and crops.
