Mohamad Yusoff Anthony, the prosecutor in the case for Sabah's fisheries department, said a magistrate's court had jailed the 13 for the three offences of poaching two protected turtle species, and encroaching on Malaysian waters.
He said Malaysian marine police seized the turtles from the Hainan fishermen's trawler late last month after they were caught in the waters off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island.
A Malaysian court jailed 17 Chinese fishermen from southern Hainan province for 18 months each for poaching hundreds of protected turtles, officials said Thursday.
