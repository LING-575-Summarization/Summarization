Arizona water managers, who are first in line to have their water cut in a shortage under an agreement with other states, called for a desalination plant built 15 years ago to be turned on.
Officials from the seven states that draw water recently forged a agreement about how to handle the current drought, which has left the Colorado River's big reservoirs--Lake Powell and Lake Mead--roughly half empty.
A complex plan hammered out by the states along a river that serves 30 million people and expected to be signed by the secretary of interior next month will do that.
