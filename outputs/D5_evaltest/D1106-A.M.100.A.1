Environmentalists called Monday for a radical overhaul of fishing practices to prevent a worldwide collapse in tuna stocks as international conservation bodies opened their first joint meeting on the species.
The five-day meeting in the western Japanese city of Kobe will look at ways to share information among regions to monitor tuna numbers and control illegal fishing vessels, officials said.
At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as punishment for overfishing, but denied allegations it has poached thousands of tons of the endangered species every year.
