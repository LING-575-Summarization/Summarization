A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's. 
 The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing hypertension was any higher than men and women getting the recommended 7 hours or more of sleep a night. 
 The researchers found that those women in the study group who slept less than or equal to 5 hours a night were twice as likely to suffer from hypertension than women who slept for the recommended seven hours or more.
