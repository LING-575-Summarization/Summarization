The Bush administration will examine whether a growing number of species, including polar bears affected by thinning sea ice, are at risk from global warming and need federal protection. 
 Last December, Interior Secretary Kempthorne proposed designating polar bears as a "threatened" species deserving of federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. 
 That category is second to "endangered" on the government's list of species believed most likely to become extinct. 
 The Fish and Wildlife Service must study how much sea ice has been lost, how fast it is melting and how that affects polar bears before Kempthorne makes a final decision by the end of the year.
