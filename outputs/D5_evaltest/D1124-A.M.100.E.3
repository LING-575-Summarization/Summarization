Efforts to plug the "mud volcano" in Indonesia have been delayed by a lack of equipment. 
 The effort involves dropping concrete balls into the crater to slow the flow of mud and rock. 
 The balls are expected to slow the flow, but not stop it. 
 The mud is expected to flow at a much reduced volume. 
 The flow is threatening to swamp a key railway line.
