Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
Wahab Mokodongan said he was not adverse to an investigation by the Attorney General's office into corruption under Soeharto.
