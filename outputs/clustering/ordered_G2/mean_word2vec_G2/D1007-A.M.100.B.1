A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
Of the nine confirmed cases, a three-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 54-year-old man have died.
Chan told reporters that initial assessment made by a Special Working Group on Influenza A H5N1 noted an association with poultry in some of the cases under investigation.
But it said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus was only found in imported chicken so far.
