The former middle school teacher achieved instant notoriety when she was accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.
The arrest is the second in as many years of a female Hillsborough County teacher accused of having sex with a teenage student.
As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.
