They are accused of firing 41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on Feb. 4.
Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Several of the officers are said to have told associates that they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they had unleashed the fusillade.
