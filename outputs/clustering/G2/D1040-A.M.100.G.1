The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley.
But Samuels told jurors that if Blake really wanted to protect his wife he never would have left her alone in a car parked on a dark street.
The prosecution had argued earlier that Blake despised his wife, and when he could not get anyone else to kill her, he pulled he trigger himself.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
