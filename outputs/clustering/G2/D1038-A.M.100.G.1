A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be affected if large amounts of ash became airborne.
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
Volcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
