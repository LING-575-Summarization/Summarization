Hariri, at least five bodyguards and four other people were killed in a massive bombing that blasted his motorcade on a Beirut seafront street earlier Monday.
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
The family also said it did not want a state funeral but one that the people of Lebanon could attend.
Opposition politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade.
