If it stays on its current path, Floyd would hit the coast of Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach.
They said they were ready to roll and could have supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's passage.
A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
"We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that."
