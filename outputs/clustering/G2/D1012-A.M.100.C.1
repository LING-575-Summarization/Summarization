Athens radio quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the plane was being accompanied by two Greek fighter jets when it went down.
Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.
Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilots flew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparently trying to take control of the Boeing 737.
The Greek government said on Sunday that no evidence of terrorism or foul play had emerged after the plane crashed.
