The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.
The report warned that the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
Scientists Thursday said they expect marine life from shore to about a mile out to have suffered the worst damage.
