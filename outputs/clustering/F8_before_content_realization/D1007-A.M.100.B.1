In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market, according to a source from the local health department.
