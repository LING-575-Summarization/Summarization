Discarded utility poles were submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's fishery resources conservation efforts.
The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).
