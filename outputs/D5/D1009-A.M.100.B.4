BOULDER, Colo. _ Sheets of white paper covered windows in the courtroom where a grand jury met Thursday to pursue its two-week-old investigation into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey.
But the white sheets were only symbolic screens in a week when major characters in the almost two-year-old murder mystery waged a war of leaks and letters, battling for the hearts and minds of the 12 jurors.
"The Ramseys did not do it," Lou Smit, a homicide detective, said in a resignation letter dated Sept. 20 but released on Sunday.
