A Boeing 747 plane carrying 50 tons of relief goods left Guangzhou in south China for tsunami- stricken Indonesia Thursday, said an official of the Ministry of Commerce.
The destination is Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the China Southern Airlines that operates the cargo flight.
This is the second batch of relief goods China has sent to the tsunami-hit countries in south and southeast Asian countries.
The first batch of 100-ton cargoes was airlifted to Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, Wednesday morning.
