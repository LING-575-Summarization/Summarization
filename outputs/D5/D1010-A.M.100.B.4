Emory University Hospital has confirmed that a brain surgery patient does not have the human version of mad cow disease, but does have a rare, fatal disorder that resembles it.
The hospital issued an alert more than a week ago saying preliminary tests on the unidentified patient produced a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
It warned that at least 500 other patients may have been exposed to the disease if they came into contact with surgical instruments used on the patient.
