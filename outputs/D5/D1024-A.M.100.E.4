KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _
Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete of the factory heavily damaged by U.S.
missiles.
Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted "Down USA" in English.
White smoke still rose from the rubble of the four-story building, which the United States said was making chemical weapons agents.
Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States struck a factory in the heart of the capital.
