The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.
A decision about whether to introduce a new species of Chinese oyster into the Chesapeake Bay has been put off a few months longer because of delays in a scientific study, Maryland officials say.
Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution.
