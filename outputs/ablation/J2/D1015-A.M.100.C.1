Conservation of tropical rain forest will be another major topic for the meeting, Angola's Deputy Minister of Agriculture Zacarias Sambeny announced here today.
The dwindling rain forest reserves and rapid expansion of the Sahara desert southwards pose a threat to the survival of the people in the African countries, Juma warned.
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
