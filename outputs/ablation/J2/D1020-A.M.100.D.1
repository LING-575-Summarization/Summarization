Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.
The recall includes dozens of brand names, based on information collected by the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service and provided by the company.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
