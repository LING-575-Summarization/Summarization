Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
The evidence includes journals that prosecutors say contain admissions to all 16 bombings attributed to the UNABOMber during a 18-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
