A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
The move came after three more people were suspected last week to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
And of the six others confirmed of being infected of the H5N1 virus, two have recovered and been discharged from hospital and four others are still under treatment with their condition satisfactory, according to the DH update.
