The researchers gave rats a toxin that induces Parkinson's and then counted dopamine-producing cells in the brains of rats that had exercised for seven days and those that had not.
The investigators identified two mutations in the same gene, one associated with Parkinson's disease in the Basque families and the other which was linked to the disease in the English family.
The rats also had significantly greater amounts of the protein GDNF, which the University of Pittsburgh scientists speculate may protect brain cells from oxygen damage produced by the disease.
