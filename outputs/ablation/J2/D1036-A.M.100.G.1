The pro-Western reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential contest with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt.
The opposition leader has charged that the hardline regime of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the December 26 presidential re-vote pitting him against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich.
"There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning," he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.
