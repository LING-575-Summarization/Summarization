Six gunmen stormed the Sipadan Island Resort off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah late Sunday, taking 20 people, including 10 foreign tourists, hostage on two boats.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
He said the hostage incident is an "isolated" case and it is safe for people to visit Sipadan island, a popular resort especially among scuba-divers.
