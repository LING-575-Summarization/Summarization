BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhua)--China pledged on Thursday it will try its utmost to minimize the impact of northeast China's Songhua River pollution on the neighboring Russia, including intensifying monitoring and water quality control measures.
The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
"We will be very clear about who's responsible," Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, said at a press conference.
