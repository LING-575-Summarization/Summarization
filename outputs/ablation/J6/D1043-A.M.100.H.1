"Assad condemned the horrible terrorist act that claimed lives of a number of Lebanese people, notably former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri," SANA said.
"For the sake of our Mujahideen (fighters) brothers in Saudi Arabia...we decided to implement the just execution of those who support this regime," one man said on a tape aired by al-Jazeera.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
