Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.
"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the government will give full response," he said.
An assertion by opposition politician Hafiz Hussain Ahmed that up to 50 tribesmen were killed in the incident was "exaggerated," Sherpao and Cheema said.
