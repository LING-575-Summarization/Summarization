LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)--Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
In Littleton (literally "Little Town"), an affluent town of 35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving as salves for recuperation.
One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial sign and said: "Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better."
