As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the agency said in a news release.
In a letter dated Friday, medical Director Robert B. Smith III said laboratory tests came back positive but also "confirmed that this is not the disease commonly called 'mad cow disease."'
Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after confirming mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in its own herd in September 2001.
