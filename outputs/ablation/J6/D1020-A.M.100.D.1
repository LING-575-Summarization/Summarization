Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua)--A U.S. company said Wednesday that it was recalling all ground beef it produced on October 22 because it may contain the potentially deadly E.coli O157: H7 bacteria.
Despite what Tauxe described as "extraordinary efforts" to prevent E. coli O157: H7 from contaminating meat, it continues to be a problem.
"By 1994, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) was proclaiming that this was one of the most successful regulatory actions in U.S. history," Crawford said.
