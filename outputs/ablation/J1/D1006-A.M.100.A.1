Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx cast suspicion on the safety of drugs in that class.
FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also applies to Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.
The FDA said that Graham decided to revise his abstract conclusion.
The drug was not pulled at that point.
