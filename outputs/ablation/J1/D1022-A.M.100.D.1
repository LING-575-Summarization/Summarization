Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea.
Whaling opponents say Japan is using research as a pretext to continue the commercial sale of whale meat.
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
