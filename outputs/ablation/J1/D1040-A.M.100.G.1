Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley.
It was important for Schwartzbach to undermine the testimony.
He said there was no need to divorce her because they were going to make a go of it.
Blake did not make eye contact with a daughter of Bakley's who also was in court.
But Samuels said no one saw Blake return to the restaurant.
