Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
But scientists said they did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980 explosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.
Volcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
