Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.
Scientists Thursday said they expect marine life from shore to about a mile out to have suffered the worst damage.
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs.
