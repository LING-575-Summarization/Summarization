Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination.
Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.
Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside world.
