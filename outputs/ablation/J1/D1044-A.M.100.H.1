Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
It is not allowed to be added to food in the Europe Union.
