Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street.
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
Van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast in September.
Many here fear the fact that Van Gogh's alleged killer is of Moroccan descent could lead to ethnic tensions in Dutch society.
van Gogh was known for his outspoken criticism of Islam.
