Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said.
This is the second batch of relief goods China has sent to the tsunami-hit countries in south and southeast Asian countries.
At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
They will leave for Aceh Province later in the day.
The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
