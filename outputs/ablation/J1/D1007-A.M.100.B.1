A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu.
But it said that eating chicken and other poultry would not pose a risk of H5N1 infection.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The virus is believed to be transmitted through contact with chickens or their feces.
