Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
But he said law-enforcement authorities would have to determine how the poisoning occurred.
Yushchenko repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals.
Doctors said Saturday that damage to Yushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.
Yushchenko flew to Austria on Friday for further tests at the clinic.
