Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare plants to a special 90-ha area for protection.
