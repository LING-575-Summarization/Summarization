Shepard, a political science major at the University of Wyoming, was not found for hours and died five days later at a hospital.
Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
