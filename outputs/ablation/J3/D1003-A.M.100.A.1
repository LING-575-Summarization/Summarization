About 100 giant pandas in northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
