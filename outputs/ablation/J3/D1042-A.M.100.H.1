Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison despite his assertion that senior officers directed and approved the actions of guards in cellblock One-Alpha.
England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on another solider.
