Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week, officials said.
The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7 percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said.
The Yellowstone contingent is the largest of a handful of remnant grizzly populations in the lower 48 states and the only one facing imminent removal from the endangered species list.
