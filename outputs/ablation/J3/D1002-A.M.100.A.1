NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.
The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.
That they had nothing to do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him because he's black?"
