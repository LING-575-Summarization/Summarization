The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
The Ramseys and their two children were the only people known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder, 18 months ago.
The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's room, but family members said it did not belong to the little girl.
