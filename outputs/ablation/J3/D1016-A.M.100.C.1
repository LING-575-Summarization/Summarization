This is the first time that demonstrators stage their action near the residence of Soeharto who resigned on May 21 amid anti-government demonstrations and bloody rioting in the country.
The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C.
Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
