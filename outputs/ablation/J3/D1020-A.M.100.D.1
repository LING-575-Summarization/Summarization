Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and cold cuts.
Last week, Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. recalled more than 28,000 pounds of deli meat because of concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria bacteria.
The recall includes dozens of brand names, based on information collected by the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service and provided by the company.
