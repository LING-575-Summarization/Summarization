A previously unknown Islamic group on the day claimed responsibility for an earlier killing of Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, due to his ties with Saudi Arabia, the Qatar-based al-Jazeera TV channel reported.
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of Hariri's, saying the Lebanese government is an independent country.
On Monday, Hariri's and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
