Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe at least one-third of the rest out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
But the researchers added that The rapid drop--the equivalent of tens of thousands of years worth of extinctions in just a century--also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmental degradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals as well.
Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when the phenomenon was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other species.
