In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, The Public Health Department of Macao said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that a deadly influenza strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global alert has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong's and Macao.
There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the bird flu that has killed children in neighboring Hong Kong, and no infected chickens have been found at the market, according to a source from the local health department.
