Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took the blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and strokes for at least 18 months.
Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx's was pulled from the market last week after The drugmaker's said a study showed Vioxx's doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.
But some doctors say this group of drugs may work in a way that increases the risk of heart problems for some patients, and some doctors point to the recommendation about high dose rofecoxib as additional reason for concern.
