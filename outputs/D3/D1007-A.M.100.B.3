All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu. 
 No evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market. 
 Sales of chicken have dropped about 30 percent since bird flu killed children in Hong Kong this month.
