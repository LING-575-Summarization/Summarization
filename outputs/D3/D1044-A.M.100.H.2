The batch thought to be responsible for the food scare predates the sampling program.
 The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
 The five local authorities involved in the investigation are in Essex and Lincolnshire counties and in the towns of South Holland, Rochdale and Basildon.
