Previously unknown Islamic group claims responsibility for earlier killing of Rafik Hariri. 
 Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut earlier in the day. 
 Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990.
