Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. 
 The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set to go on trial in August. 
 Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, pistol-whipped him and stole $20.
