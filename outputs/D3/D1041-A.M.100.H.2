Members of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society environmental group appealed yet again Friday to government agencies not to let the``Amorgos"pollution case go any further and see to it that the undersea wreckage is removed at the earliest possible date.
 The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be``digested"by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.
