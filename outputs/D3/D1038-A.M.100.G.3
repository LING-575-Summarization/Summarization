After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash. 
 When the eruption ended, government monitoring instruments showed a sharp decrease in the seismic activity. 
 No molten rock flowed from the point in the mountain's lava dome where the steam vented.
