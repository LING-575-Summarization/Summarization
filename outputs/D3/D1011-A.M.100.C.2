A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.
 Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.
 Doctors believe some of those cases are caused by stress.
