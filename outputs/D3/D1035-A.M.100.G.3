Veterans groups from U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Vietnam turned out Thursday to dedicate the Vietnam Friendship Village. 
 The cluster of eight buildings north of Hanoi will be home to young and old who still suffer a quarter-century after the Vietnam War ended. 
 No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes during a 10-year period.
