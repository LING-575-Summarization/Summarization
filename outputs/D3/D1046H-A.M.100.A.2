At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
 Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion Australian dollars (about 764 million US dollars) in loans and grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunami disaster.
 Bangladesh would airlift and ship 1 , 000 metric tons of high energy biscuits (HEB) for the tsunami victims of Indonesia and Sri Lanka this week.
