President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations. 
 President asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case. 
 President did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal.
