The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
"This hurricane," said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, "could be catastrophic."
"We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that."
