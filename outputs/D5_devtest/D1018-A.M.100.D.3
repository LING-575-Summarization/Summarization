Paul van der Sloot, the father of Joran van der Sloot, a suspect in the Natalee Holloway case, was questioned by police in Aruba. 
 He was hoping he could help solve the mystery of Holloway's disappearance. 
 On Saturday, a judge ordered the Dutch teenager and his two friends, Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe, to stay in jail for at least another week while investigators continue their search for clues. 
 On Monday, a fourth man was to appear before a judge. 
 He was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc jockey on the party boat "Tattoo." 
 Croes was arrested early Friday, a day after giving police a statement.
