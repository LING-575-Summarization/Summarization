In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, conservationists were concerned about the destruction of mangroves and other coastal vegetations along the Indian coast. 
 The UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said it fears the reconstruction of tsunami-hit areas could put pressure on mangroves and other coastal vegetations. 
 The Indian government has been criticized for allowing industrial and commercial activities along the coast. 
 The tsunami struck as India was reviewing coastal regulations, which critics say were diluted to allow increasing commercial activities near the sea.
