Another killer avalanche struck Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
They were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared dead under the snow.
Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche yesterday.
An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
