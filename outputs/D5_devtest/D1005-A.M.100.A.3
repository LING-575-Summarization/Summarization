A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's patients, when off their dopamine-increasing medications, learn better from negative feedback, such as being scolded, than from positive feedback, such as being praised. 
 The research also identified a group of brain receptors in mice that appear to be responsible for nicotine addiction.
