Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries including Japan maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea.
