JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Two South Africans are among the 21 people taken hostage by gunmen in Malaysia's famed diving island of Sipadan. 
 The gunmen, believed to be Filipinos, apparently surprised the tourists on a beach on Sipadan Island on Sunday night. 
 In a press briefing, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur has received a note from the assistant director of the Malaysian Police informing the Philippines of the kidnapping. 
 He added that President Estrada had given the instructions to the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force in support of the border patrol agreement between the Philippines and Malaysia.
