Gunmen believed to be Muslim rebels kidnapped 21 people from a Malaysian resort on the island of Sipadan on February 2. 
 They are believed to have taken the hostages to the Philippines, where they are fighting for the release of militants held in U.S. jails. 
 One of the hostages, a Filipino woman, managed to escape. 
 She told police that one of the gunmen was a member of the Moro National Liberation Front, a Muslim rebel group that signed a peace accord with Malaysia in 1996.
