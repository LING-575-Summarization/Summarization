Soeharto stepped down on May 21 amid mounting public pressure. 
 He was accused of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas. 
 The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth. 
 A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto. 
 He swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in a statement broadcast by his own daughter's television station early this month.
