What do stem cells have to do with the election?
The debate centers on whether the embryos used in stem cell research are human beings.
Three years ago, Bush limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines in existence.
In doing their research, scientists take a few stem cells from very young embryos and grow them into colonies, called stem cell "lines."
Some people, including some religious groups, say embryonic stem cell research should be banned because it ends a human life.
