NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their case.
There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.
