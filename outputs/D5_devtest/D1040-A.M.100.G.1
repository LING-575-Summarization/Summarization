Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor's celebrity should n't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday in closing arguments.
But Samuels told jurors that if Blake really wanted to protect his wife he never would have left her alone in a car parked on a dark street.
Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.
