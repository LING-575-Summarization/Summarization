The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but a small number of countries including Japan maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year. 
 Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a meeting of the IWC held in Ulsan, South Korea last week. 
 Opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have a voting majority at the IWC for the first time since the 1986 ban was imposed.
