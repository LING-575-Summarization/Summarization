Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border, where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of snow and rubble for survivors. 
 At least 30 people, some of them critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television said. 
 In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000 tourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche thundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00 p.m.
