The avalanches were the worst in Austria since a series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in January 1954. 
 The avalanches were caused by heavy snow that had fallen since the second week of February and the high winds that have whipped it into drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.
