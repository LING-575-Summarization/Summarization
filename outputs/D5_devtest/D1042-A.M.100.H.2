Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, England replied: "He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size."
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
Then Pohl asked England what training she had for prison work.
