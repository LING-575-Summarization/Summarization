Lynndie England's guilty plea would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison. 
 She faces up to 6 1/2 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy, maltreating detainees and dereliction of duty. 
 Prosecutors described Graner, who is said to be England's ex-boyfriend, as the ringleader of a group of guards who mistreated Iraqi detainees. 
 He was photographed giving the thumbs-up sign behind a pile of naked detainees and ordering them to masturbate. 
 He is serving a 10-year prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after he was found guilty in January.
