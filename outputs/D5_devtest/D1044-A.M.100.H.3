The red-colored dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report. 
 The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a large consignment of Worcester Sauce made by Premier Foods. 
 Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
