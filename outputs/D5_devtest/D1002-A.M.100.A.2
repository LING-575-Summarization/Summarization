The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun.
The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury.
Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which hit him.
When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said, at least one of the officers wept.
