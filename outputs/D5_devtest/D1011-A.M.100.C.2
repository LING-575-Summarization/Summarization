Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.
The causes of the disorder are still unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression.
According to the National Eating Disorder Association, about 7 million U.S. females and 1 million males suffer from an eating disorder.
These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the EDNOS grab bag.
