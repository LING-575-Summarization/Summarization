Theodore Kacznski, the so-called UNABOMber, was moved from Sacramento County Jail to a federal prison 20 miles southeast of Oakland in California. 
 Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12. 
 Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
