Eight days after the shooting at Columbine High School, students returned to school for the first time since the tragedy. 
 On April 17, 2005, a gunman killed 12 students and a teacher at the school before killing himself. 
 The shooter had complained about the treatment of athletes at the school. 
 The school's athletic equipment was also trapped, probably for the rest of the school year. 
 The Colorado Rockies opened their doors to Columbine players, allowing the team to work out in their hitting cages and tour Coors Field.
