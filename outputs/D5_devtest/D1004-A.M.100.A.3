The death toll in Papua New Guinea's tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected to rise. 
 Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another. 
 A 10-meter tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 km north of PNG's capital city of Port Moresby. 
 The disaster occurred 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale took place.
