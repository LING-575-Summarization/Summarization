The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
About 20 people, including foreign tourists, were taken hostage by armed pirates on Sipadan island off the Sabah coast, East Malaysia, Sunday night, according to police sources Monday.
Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
Philippine officials initially said they were investigating possible links to the Abu Sayyaf.
