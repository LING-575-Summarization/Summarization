Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and six bodyguards were killed in a bomb blast in Beirut on Monday. 
 He was the architect of Lebanon's revival from a devastating 15-year civil war. 
 Opposition politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade. 
 At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral. 
 The rites were organized by the Hariri family, which refused a state funeral to underscore its anger at the government. 
 The meandering two-hour march through the streets became as much a show of Lebanon's struggle for unity as an occasion for mourning.
