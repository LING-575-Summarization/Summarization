The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica, @ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution.
The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.
But some oysters do survive in the bay.
