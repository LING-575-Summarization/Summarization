Statoil has requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak. 
 Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd) and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself. 
 The proposed solution would permit the company in the short term to pump up some 100,000 bpd while waiting for the platform repairs to be completed.
