Discard Discarded utility poles were submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's fishery resources conservation efforts. 
 Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along the coastline to enhance fishery resources. 
 With underground electrical wiring becoming a general trend in recent years, Taipower has donated many waste cement utility poles for the creation of more than 10,000 artificial reefs in 79 coastal regions, including Taoyuan County's Yungan, Hsinchun County's Nanliao, Taichung County's Wuchi, Changhua County's Wangkung and Hualien County's Yenliao, for conservation of fishery resources and other marine life.
