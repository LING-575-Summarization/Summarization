The U.S. Soccer Federation, which permits headgear but does not endorse it, contends that marketing to the fears of parents has trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing concussions. 
 The headgear debate is occurring at a time when some studies indicate that concussions occur in soccer at a rate similar to football. 
 This is also a moment with disagreement on whether heading the ball can cause concussions or long-term brain impairment.
