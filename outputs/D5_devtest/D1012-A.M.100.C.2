Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
The pilots also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to the aircraft.
A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
Greek radio and television stations reported that the air force pilots in the two fighter jets did not see any movement in the cockpit of the airliner before the crash and it was unclear if the two pilots were in their seats.
