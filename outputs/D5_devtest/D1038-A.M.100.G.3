On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the Cascade mountain chain in Oregon, erupted for the first time in 18 years. 
 The explosion killed 57 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. 
 On Friday, the mountain roared back to life with a giant plume of steam and ash. 
 The Federal Aviation Administration warned aircraft to avoid the area around the volcano. 
 On Sunday, a tremor shook the mountain for 25 minutes, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption.
