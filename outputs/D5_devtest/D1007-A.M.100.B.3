The H5N1 virus has not been found in 15,000 chicken blood samples taken in Guangdong Province. 
 A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao. 
 Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms.
