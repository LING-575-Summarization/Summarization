In 2000, states and the federal government agreed to a 10-year plan to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. 
 The goal was to reduce pollution and algae blooms that kill fish and crabs. 
 Since then, the number of oysters in the bay has dropped sharply and the number of watermen has dropped because of low oyster harvests. 
 The bay's grasses are supposed to grow to 185,000 acres by 2010 -- 35 percent of the goal. 
 A survey of the bay's grasses in 2003 found about 64,000 acres -- 35 percent of the goal. 
 Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that anybody has spent five years trying to save it.
