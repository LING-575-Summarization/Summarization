Viktor Yushchenko, the opposition candidate in Ukraine's Nov. 21 presidential election, was admitted to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, for treatment of poisoning by dioxin. 
 His condition deteriorated and he was transferred to a specialist hospital. 
 Doctors believe he was poisoned by orally administered dioxin. 
 He is expected to make a full recovery. 
 The U.S. urged the Ukrainian government to fully investigate Yushchenko's poisoning. 
 The U.S. has not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election.
