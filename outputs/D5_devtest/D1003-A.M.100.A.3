China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area. 
 The application cited the rarity of the bamboo-chomping bears, along with the variety and beauty of the area's ecology and landscape. 
 More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan home to 76 percent of them.
