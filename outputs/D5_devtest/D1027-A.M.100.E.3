Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney are on trial for the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student. 
 Both are charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. 
 If convicted, they face the death penalty. 
 Prosecutors say they lured Shepard out of a bar, beat him and left him to die in a remote area east of Laramie, Wyoming.
