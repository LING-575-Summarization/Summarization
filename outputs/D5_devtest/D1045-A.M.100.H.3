On Nov. 13 an explosion at a chemical plant in Jilin province caused massive amounts of benzene to flow into the Songhua River. 
 The chemicals moved downstream into Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, prompting officials to shut down water supplies. 
 The plant was run by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company, which is under the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp.
