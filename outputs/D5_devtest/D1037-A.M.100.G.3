The Bush administration's proposed 2006 budget calls for cutting spending on the federal clean-water fund to $730 million, from $1.1 billion last year. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency says the cut is part of a multi-year effort to commit $6.8 billion through 2011 to improve sewage treatment infrastructure.
