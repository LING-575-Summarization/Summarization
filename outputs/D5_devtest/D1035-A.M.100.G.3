Agent Orange was used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to defoliate trees and kill crops that sustained guerrilla bands. 
 It left behind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently created during the manufacturing process. 
 The U.S. and Vietnam are discussing a joint study of the effects of Agent Orange. 
 The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has been asked to consider whether it is feasible to do a study so long after the spraying, in a nation where health records and disease measures are notoriously incomplete.
