The U.S. Department of Interior announced that it would remove grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park from the endangered species list. 
 Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. 
 The proposed delisting could go into effect as early as 2006, but litigation could delay any ultimate effort to remove federal protections. 
 The National Wildlife Federation supports delisting, saying it highlights the success of the endangered species law. 
 The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and other groups say that too many threats still exist for the bears.
