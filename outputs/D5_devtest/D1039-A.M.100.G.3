Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death while cycling in Amsterdam on Tuesday. 
 He had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam. 
 His alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested shortly after the attack. 
 Prosecutors said the motive was believed to have been his radical Islamic views, based on the content of two papers, one stuck on the dagger used to attack the director, the other found on the suspected killer during a search.
