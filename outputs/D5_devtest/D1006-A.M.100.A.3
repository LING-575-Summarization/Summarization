In September 2004, Merck & Co. recalled its arthritis drug Vioxx after a clinical trial showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
 The drug had been used by 20 million Americans since its approval in 1999 and was the company's top-selling product. 
 Merck had spent $195 million to promote Vioxx as a wonder drug for the aging baby boomers. 
 The FDA, which approved Vioxx for use, had been concerned about the drug's cardiovascular risks since at least 2000 but did not issue a warning until 2004.
