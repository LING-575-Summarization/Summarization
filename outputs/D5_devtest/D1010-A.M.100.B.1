Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
Medical tests on a young Irishman have confirmed that he is suffering from variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, a Dublin hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.
Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
