A woman stole her identity and ran up $100,000 worth of bills. 
 She used the stolen Social Security number to get a new credit card. 
 The new card was used to pay for a car, rent, and a lawyer's fees. 
 The identity thief ran up bills in her name and threatened to sue her if she didn't pay up. 
 She used a pen, a computer and a phone. 
 She spent 500 hours working to clear her name.
