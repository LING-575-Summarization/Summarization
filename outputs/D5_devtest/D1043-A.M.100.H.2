Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination.
Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside world.
