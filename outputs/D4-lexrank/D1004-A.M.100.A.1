Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape in the West Sepik province on Friday night had wiped out the heavily populated villages near Aitape in the West Sepik province and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
