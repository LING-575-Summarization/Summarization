Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, officials said.
 Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
 Hirsi Ali, who has lived under police protection for two years, said she and Van Gogh had received death threats after the film was broadcast.
 van Gogh was known for his outspoken criticism of Islam.
