In a letter dated Friday, medical Director Robert B. Smith III said laboratory tests came back positive but also "confirmed that this is not the disease commonly called 'mad cow disease."'
 The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
 A 48-month-old cow that died recently has been confirmed as having had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
 The European Commission helps co-fund the testing with national governments.
