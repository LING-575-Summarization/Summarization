Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
 The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit.
 Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.
 A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported.
