The managed reserve method is `` the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease , '' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation .In desperation , the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster , which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake 's oyster diseases .Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay .Will it fail to multiply and instead die , leaving the bay no better off ?
