The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
 China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
 There are also many endangered and unique plants in the area.
