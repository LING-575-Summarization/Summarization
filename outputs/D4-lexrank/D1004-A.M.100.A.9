Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out, and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
 The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area.
 Sixteen people in the devastated Arop village were confirmed dead, and two children had died in the Malalo village, which was wiped out.
