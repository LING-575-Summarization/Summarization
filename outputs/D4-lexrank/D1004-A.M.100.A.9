Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
 Sixteen people were confirmed dead in the devastated Arop village, and two children had died in Malol, which was wiped out.
 The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map, leaving hundreds people dead or missing.
