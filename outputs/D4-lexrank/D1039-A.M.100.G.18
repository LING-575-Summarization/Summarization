A Dutch filmmaker who outraged members of the Muslim community with his works' attacks on the treatment of women in Islamic society was gunned down and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street Tuesday morning.
 Witnesses said a gunman opened fire on Theo van Gogh, 47, as the filmmaker bicycled down Linnaeus Street in the eastern part of the city, then chased him on foot, shot him again and stabbed him . Some reports said the killer slit van Gogh's throat with a knife as the victim lay helpless on the pavement.
