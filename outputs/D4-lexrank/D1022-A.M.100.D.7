Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
 Ruddock said Australia was "vigorously opposed" to the Japanese proposals and would press its efforts to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
 Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium.
