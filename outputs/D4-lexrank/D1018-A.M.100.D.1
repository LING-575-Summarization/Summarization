A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17--the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
 Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.

But Tuesday, John said Deepak Kalpoe told him in jail this weekend that he and his brother dropped Van Der Sloot and Holloway off at the Marriott hotel before they went home.
Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Alabama, High School with 124 other students and seven chaperones when she vanished during the early hours of May 30.
Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but both have since been released.
