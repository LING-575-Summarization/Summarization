Three giant pandas living in Beijing Zoo will be sent to Wolong of Sichuan Province, southwest China, Wednesday and three others in Sichuan will fly to Beijing Friday, under an exchange program aimed to maintain the biodiversity of the giant panda population.
 "It is impossible for giant pandas fed in captivity to survive through natural selection, which will result in similar heredities, "said a zookeeper.
 "The inbreeding among giant pandas in the same areas easily leads to the species' degeneration."
