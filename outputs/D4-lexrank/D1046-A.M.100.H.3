An extremely powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed devastated many parts of North Sumatra and Aceh on Dec. 26 last year, killing more than 100,000 people there.
 The official of the ministry said that at least 476,619 people were refugees, and the figure could increase as there were still many others uncounted by the officials.
 A powerful earthquake of 8.7 degrees on Richter scale shocked many parts of the provinces of North Sumatra and Aceh.
