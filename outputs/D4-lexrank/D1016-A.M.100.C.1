Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
Atmonegoro claimed yesterday that a relatively unknown local by the name of Yohanes Yacob had been hired as former president Soeharto's lawyer and that he had not appointed any foreign attorneys.
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said earlier this week that his ministry was ready to assist the Attorney General's Office in rescuing state assets possibly stashed abroad during the Soeharto era.
