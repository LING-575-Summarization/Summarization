The concern over concussions, and whether headgear can protect against them, has become a growing issue for youth soccer associations In September, the New York State West Youth Soccer Association, which governs more than 200 clubs and 80 000 kids in the Buffalo-Rochester area, voted to require headgear for all players under 14. Not all medical soccer experts oppose headgear. The headgear debate is occurring at a time when some studies indicate that concussions occur in soccer at a rate similar to football.
