A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
 Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign, presidential spokesman Kim Man-Soo said, indicating Hong's resignation would be accepted.
 Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a presidential election in late 1997.
 He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
