Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms were closed.
 Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
 On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was detected.
