 Macao experts today warned residents to be careful but not panic over the bird flu that has killed children in neighboring Hong Kong.
 No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public Health Department said.
 But they did urge people to be careful in contacting birds, take care of proper personal and environmental hygiene and cook their food thoroughly.
