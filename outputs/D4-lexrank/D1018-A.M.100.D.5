Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
 Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
 A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
 The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
