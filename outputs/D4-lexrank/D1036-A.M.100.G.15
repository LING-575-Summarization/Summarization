Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
 Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
