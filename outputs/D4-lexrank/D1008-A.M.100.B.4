On a crystal clear afternoon, the light air hinting of fall, the Miss Brandy motored up to a dock on the Kent Narrows in Grasonville, Md., in front of W.H.
 From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and those to return to the bay.
 Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the oysters back into the water.
 For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.
