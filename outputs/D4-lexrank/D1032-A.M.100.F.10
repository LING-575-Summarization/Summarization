The shutdown of Snorre and the Vigdis field meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil a day in production, or 6.4 percent of Norway's roughly 3.2 million barrels a day of production.
 Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
