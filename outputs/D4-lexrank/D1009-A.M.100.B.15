White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
 Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
 There have been no arrests, and authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under suspicion.
