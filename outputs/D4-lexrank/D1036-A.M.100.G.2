Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday . "There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment."
 Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
 Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was poisoned.
