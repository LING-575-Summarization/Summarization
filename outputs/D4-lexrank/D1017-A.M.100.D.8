Tropical storm Floyd strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United States. "The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the U S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami "We think it could continue to strengthen and become a major hurricane in three days."
