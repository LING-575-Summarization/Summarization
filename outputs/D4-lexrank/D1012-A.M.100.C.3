By Sunday afternoon, senior Greek and Cypriot officials began minimizing the likelihood of terrorism.
 "The first indications," said Marios Karoyian, a spokesman for the Cyprus president, Tassos Papadopoulos, "are that it was not caused by a terrorist act."
 In Athens, a senior Defense Ministry official said: "We're not ruling out anything.
 But that the plane was not shot down by armed F-16 jet fighters suggests that this may not have been a terrorist attack."
