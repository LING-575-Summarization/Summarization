LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)--The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
 "It's when something like this happens that we realize the community's there for us," she said Sunday.
