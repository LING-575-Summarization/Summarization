Fox is returning to TV _ in a commercial praising Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for his stance on stem cell research.
 George Bush is putting limits on it," Fox says in an ad Kerry's campaign unveiled Thursday.
 "Stem cell research can help millions of Americans whose lives have been touched by devastating illnesses.
 I say lives are at stake and it's time for leadership.
 The campaign said the ad would run in local media markets in states considered battlegrounds.
