"They are trying to thwart the evolution of headgear in soccer because they think it will scare soccer moms away from the sign-up table," Skeen said of soccer federation officials.
 The soccer federation, which permits headgear but does not endorse it, fears that its wide use would undermine the assertion that soccer is a safe alternative to football, Skeen said.
 Not all medical soccer experts oppose headgear.
 Full90 does not claim that its headgear prevent concussions.
 "I think it's very good for safety."
