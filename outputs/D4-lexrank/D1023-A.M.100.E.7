ROMEAn avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
 At least 30 people, some of them critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television said.
 In Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had risen to seven.
