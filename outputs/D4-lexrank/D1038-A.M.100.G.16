A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
 "The eruption was predominantly steam but containing a little bit of ash," he said adding that there were no lava or mud flows from the crater and that the alert level in the region had not been raised.
