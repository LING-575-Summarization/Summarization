Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber--a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
 Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a separate case in New Jersey.
 Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years.
