In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.
 The three were questioned and released shortly after Holloway's May 30 disappearance.
 Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead.
