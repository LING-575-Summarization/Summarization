After the 1980 eruption, a lahar traveled 50 miles from Mount St. Helens, ripping out bridges and destroying homes.
 In comparison, Friday's eruption was a "hiccup," USGS geologist Tom Pierson told reporters.
 Absent such a flow of molten rock, USGS scientists have said it is unlikely that recent increases in seismic activity on Mount St. Helens will result in a significant eruption that could endanger people or property outside the immediate vicinity.
 "Exactly how it is related is still a matter of speculation," he said.
