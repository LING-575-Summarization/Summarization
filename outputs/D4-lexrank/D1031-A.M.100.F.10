But, he said, it remains unclear whether mangroves and coral reefs had a significant protective effect against a "tsunami on the scale that we've just witnessed."
 Some scientists this week said human activity in the coastal zone contributed to the immense damage on shore--such as building tourist hotels too close to the water and tearing out mangrove forests to put in shrimp aquaculture farms throughout Asia.
 When a tsunami passes, reef structures grind into each other causing extensive damage.
