Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1 800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow. To accommodate the 1 965 Columbine students, the school day is being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p m. The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
