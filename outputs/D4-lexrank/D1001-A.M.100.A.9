The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.
 After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that repeatedly reassured mourners that they were "part of a larger community."
 "Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High School," Gov.
 Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for parents and schools.
 Graham praised the Columbine community for uniting under the pain of a tragedy that could have torn it apart.
