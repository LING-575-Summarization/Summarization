Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
 "We are waiting for this, for justice," he said, "and we feel strong."
 The mother, Kadiadou Diallo, and two of her children, are expected to arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on Thursday morning.
 The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
