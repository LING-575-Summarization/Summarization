While attention is clearly focused on the rising human toll of the destruction, some dive operators and marine biologists are reporting that from Sri Lanka to Thailand corals are suffocating under layers of mud, heaps of rotten fish, are clogging beachfronts, and rare turtle nesting sites have been washed out to sea. A UN task force based in Geneva will assess two things: environmental damage that threatens human health, and the toll on the ecological resources--many of which support tourism and the fishing industry.
