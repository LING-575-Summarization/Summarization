Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping . But Philippine officials quickly expressed skepticism over the statement.
 A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track down the kidnappers.
