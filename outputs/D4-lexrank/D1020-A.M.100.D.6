In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
 And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of that year.
 Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22.
 The investigators say they do not know how the listeria contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.
