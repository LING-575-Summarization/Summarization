Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
 A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
 After losing contact with the Athens airport's control tower, the Greek air force immediately sent two F-16 fighter jets to lead the airliner.
 Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.
