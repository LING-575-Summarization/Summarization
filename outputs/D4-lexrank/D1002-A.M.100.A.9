The defense lawyers called their clients "political prisoners," and said they would show the incident was "a tragedy, not a crime," because the officers had "reasonable" cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired.
 When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said, at least one of the officers wept.
 What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers.
