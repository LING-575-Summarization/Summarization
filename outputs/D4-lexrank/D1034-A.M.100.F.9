 For two decades, scientists have been trying to figure out why amphibian populations worldwide are vanishing.
 The fact that more than 200 amphibian species are showing rapid enigmatic declines is alarming, Stuart said, because it is probably linked to recent disruptions in rain and storm patterns.
