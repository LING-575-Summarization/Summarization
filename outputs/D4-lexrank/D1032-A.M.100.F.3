More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
 Three helicopters and four ships were helping evacuate the rest of the staff, Norwegian news agency NTB said.
 "We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
 Hetland could not say when production was expected to resume.
