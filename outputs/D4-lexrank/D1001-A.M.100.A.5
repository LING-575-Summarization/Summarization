Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1 800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow. Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. "It's like getting back to normal life," he said.
