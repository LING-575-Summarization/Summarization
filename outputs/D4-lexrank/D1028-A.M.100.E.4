The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
 Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
 The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
 He is also charged with a third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
