Three suspects--Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, the son of a prominent judicial official, and brothers Satish Kalpoe, 18, and Deepak Kalpoe, 21--are still being held and are now the focus of an intensifying investigation into the disappearance of the girl.
 The three were questioned and released shortly after Holloway's May 30 disappearance.
 It's not clear how the latest suspect, Steve Croes, is involved.
