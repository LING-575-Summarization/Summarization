The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit.
 Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.
 After the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers "for more than an hour," said Ioannis Pantazaratos, head of the air traffic control tower at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, "we had no idea who was flying the plane."
