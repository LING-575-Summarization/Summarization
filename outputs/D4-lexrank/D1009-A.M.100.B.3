"The Ramseys did not do it," Lou Smit, a homicide detective, said in a resignation letter dated Sept. 20 but released on Sunday.
 "The `case' tells me that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter, that a very dangerous killer is still out there and no one is actively looking for him," Smit said in his letter.
 Meanwhile, my family knows a vicious killer still walks the streets."
 Yet others critical of how the investigation has been handled do not support Ramsey.
