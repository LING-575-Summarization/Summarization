Hypnotism has become a successful experiment to rid extra fat in obese men and women in Kuwait, a specialist said here today.
 Kazen Abul, a social worker in close contact with the experiment in the country, told Kuwait News Agency that "hypnotherapy of obesity has made an unprecedented success in Kuwait . The number of people coming to clinics for this particular treatment is on the rise."
 Kuwait has a large percentage of obesity cases among its 700,000 citizens, especially women, because of less activities and unrational food structure.
