Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
 "Assad condemned the horrible terrorist act that claimed lives of a number of Lebanese people, notably former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri," SANA said.
 Hariri was important to Lebanon as a politician and a symbol.
