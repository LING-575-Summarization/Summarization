Hong Kong's Department of Health (DH) on Thursday reported four more suspected cases of Influenza A H5N1, bringing the number to 10 in addition to nine confirmed cases.
 In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
 The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
