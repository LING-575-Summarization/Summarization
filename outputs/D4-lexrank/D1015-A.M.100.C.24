Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
 In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties . Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
 Experts from across China today called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black gibbons in southern China's Hainan province.
