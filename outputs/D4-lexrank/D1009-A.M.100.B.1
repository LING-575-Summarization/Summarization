In recent days, as a succession of Boulder police detectives have appeared before the grand jury, court observers say the Ramseys and their defenders are trying to score a counterpunch with the jurors.
Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
