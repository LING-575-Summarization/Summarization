"[a horrible murder case] is going to [this grand jury]," Jim Carpenter, the governor's spokesman, said on Thursday Referring to the Whites' letter, he added, "There was nothing in the letter that has changed that view." Before the grand jury started work on Sept. 15, Steve Thomas, the lead police detective in the almost two-year-old murder mystery, wrote a resignation letter denouncing the office of Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, as "thoroughly compromised."
