The shutdown of Snorre and the Vigdis field meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil a day in production, or 6.4 percent of Norway's roughly 3.2 million barrels a day of production.
 Norwegian oil group Statoil said Monday that production on two of its platforms in the North Sea shut down last week because of a gas leak would probably remain suspended until at least next week.
