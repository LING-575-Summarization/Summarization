More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the Snorre A and Snorre B platforms became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130 000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said. Three helicopters and four ships were helping evacuate the rest of the staff, Norwegian news agency NTB said.
