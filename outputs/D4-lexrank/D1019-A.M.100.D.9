"Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us," Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf, said in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
 Syed Hamid said the names of the hostages would be released by the Malaysian police.
 Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
