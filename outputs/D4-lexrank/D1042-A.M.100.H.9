- On October 23, 2003, England conspired with then Corporal Charles Graner to maltreat a prisoner who was subject to her orders and then "posed for a photograph holding a strap tied as a leash around a naked detainee's neck."
 "I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to," England, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison.
