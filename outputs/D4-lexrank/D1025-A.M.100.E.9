Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
 Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
 "The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
