The proposal to de-list grizzly bears in the area surrounding Yellowstone National Park, which has alarmed some environmentalists, highlights the contrasting views of the 32-year-old Endangered Species Act.
 Stripping the bears of protection could eventually clear the way for hunting of grizzlies in that region.
 The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7 percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said.
