Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber--a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
 Attorneys are hopeful they can impanel 12 impartial jurors and six alternates to decide the fate of Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former college math instructor, who was arrested at a remote Montana cabin last year, United Press International reported.
