Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
 He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
 Hariri was important to Lebanon as a politician and a symbol.
