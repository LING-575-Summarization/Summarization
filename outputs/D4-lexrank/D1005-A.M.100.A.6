The Bush campaign called the ad false "George Bush is the first president to allow for the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and has provided hundreds of millions of federal dollars for stem cell research," said Brian Jones, a Bush spokesman. Three years ago, Bush limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines in existence Less than a third of those initial lines are available to researchers because of problems with the lines' growth or their ownership.
