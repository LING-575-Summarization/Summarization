A Boeing 747 plane carrying 50 tons of relief goods left Guangzhou in south China for tsunami- stricken Indonesia Thursday, said an official of the Ministry of Commerce.
 The destination is Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the China Southern Airlines that operates the cargo flight.
 The first batch of 100-ton cargoes was airlifted to Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, Wednesday morning.
 They will leave for Aceh Province later in the day.
 At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
