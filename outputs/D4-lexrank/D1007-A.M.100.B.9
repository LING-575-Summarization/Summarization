The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
 The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is only found in poultry.
 "There is no report of H5N1 cases among chickens so far, so eating chickens is safe," Zhao Changwang, director of the Shenzhen Institute of Veterinary Epidemic Prevention, told Shenzhen citizens today.
