Discarded utility poles were submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's fishery resources conservation efforts. The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower). COA officials said the artificial reefs not only function to prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds but also help increase fish stocks. At least three officials were disciplined due to aftermath of that incident.
