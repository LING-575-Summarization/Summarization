Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
 The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
 But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
 Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in a separate report.
