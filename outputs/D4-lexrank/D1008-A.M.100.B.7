This grim portrait doesn't mean that there are no oysters left in the Chesapeake Both Virginia and Maryland have been spending several million dollars each year to restore native populations, and they are considering introducing a heartier nonnative species to the bay. Nonetheless, the commercial fishery business--the packing and shipping that put Chesapeake Bay oysters on the map--has all but collapsed. It features a giant raw oyster bar, cooking demonstrations, live music and an oyster-shucking competition Admission is $5 over age 12; www usoysterfest com.
