The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a shrublike plant grown widely in Asia.
 It can be found in more than 200 diet supplements, in pills and powders, drinks and diet bars, for sale in health food stores and on the Internet.
 Its advocates say it decreases appetite, raises metabolism, improves concentration, burns fat and even enhances sexual performance.
 But to its critics, ephedra is a potentially dangerous substance that urgently needs more study and regulation.
