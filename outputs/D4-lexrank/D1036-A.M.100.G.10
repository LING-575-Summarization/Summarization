New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
 Meanwhile, Yushchenko, who is popular in the West, called for an investigation to determine how he was poisoned by dioxin, but said it should be conducted after the Dec. 26 re-run to avoid influencing the results.
