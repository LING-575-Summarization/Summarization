According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
 The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
 No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
