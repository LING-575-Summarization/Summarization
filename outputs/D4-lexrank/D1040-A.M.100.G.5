Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined Blake could face life in prison if convicted. Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said. Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
