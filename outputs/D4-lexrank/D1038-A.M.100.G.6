Volcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
 A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
 Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
