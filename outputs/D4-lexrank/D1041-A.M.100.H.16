About 65 percent of the Persian Gulf's reefs have been destroyed, the report said.
 The conservation union--which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species--also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
 The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
