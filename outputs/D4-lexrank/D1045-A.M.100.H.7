China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
 Benzene is a substance harmful to human health.
 The official said upon receiving the report, the administration immediately sent experts to Heilongjiang Province to assist local pollution-control efforts.
 Quality of the river water is under close observation for 24 hours every day.
