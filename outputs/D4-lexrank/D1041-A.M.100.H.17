About 65 percent of the Persian Gulf's reefs have been destroyed, the report said.
 The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
 The conservation union--which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species--also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
 About 16 percent of global reefs had been damaged by the bleaching.
