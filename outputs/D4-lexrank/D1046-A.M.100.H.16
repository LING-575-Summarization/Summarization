The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
 This is the second batch of relief goods China has sent to the tsunami-hit countries in south and southeast Asian countries.
 Uzbekistan on Monday sent a plane with 35 metric tons (39 short tons) of humanitarian aid to tsunami-hit Indonesia, the Foreign Ministry said.
 At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
