Van Gogh said he had received threats after the airing of his movie "Submission," which he made with a right-wing Dutch politician who had renounced the Islamic faith of her birth.
 It is assumed that Van Gogh was killed because of his outspoken criticism of Islam after police said the alleged gunman was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
 After it became known that van Gogh's alleged killer was of Moroccan descent, politicians and commentators feared ethnic tensions and called for calm.
