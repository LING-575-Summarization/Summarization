Tribal chief Nawab Akbar Bugti vowed to fight the government, saying hundreds of his supporters were ready to face the security forces.
 On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
 Nausherwani said no arrests have been made so far.
 No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
