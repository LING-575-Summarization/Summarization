Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, officials said.
 Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
 Friends and associates said van Gogh had received anonymous death threats after Dutch television aired his controversial short film "Submission" in August.
