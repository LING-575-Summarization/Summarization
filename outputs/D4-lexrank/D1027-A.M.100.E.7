The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
 Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October.
 Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted.
 McKinney's trial is set for Aug. 9.
 Opening arguments in Russell Henderson's trial have been scheduled for April 6, according to Judge Jeffrey Donnell.
