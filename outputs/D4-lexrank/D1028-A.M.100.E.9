Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber--a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
 The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
 Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a separate case in New Jersey.
