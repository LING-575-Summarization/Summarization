Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after confirming mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in its own herd in September 2001.
 Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
 The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
 The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
