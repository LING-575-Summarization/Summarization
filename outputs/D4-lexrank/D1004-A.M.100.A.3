"We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't have the children," Dalle said.
 Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
 Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
 Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
