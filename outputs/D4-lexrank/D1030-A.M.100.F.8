 The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine per dose . The agency also is looking at requiring product labels that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven days.
 At least eight deaths in Texas and more than 40 nationwide have been linked to ephedrine _ a stimulant found in certain Asian plants _ said Cynthia Culmo of the state health department.
 Banning ephedrine from over-the-counter sales would affect the multimillion-dollar, herbal-supplement industry in Texas.
