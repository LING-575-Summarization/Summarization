Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according to the report . Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water . Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat . The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are experiencing drought.
 "There may be an issue with frogs, that they are not warm and fuzzy," she said.

But they added that the phenomenon also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmental degradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals as well.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when it was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other species.
