A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons . He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons . He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.
 Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist regime . But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why American should send cruise missiles here.
