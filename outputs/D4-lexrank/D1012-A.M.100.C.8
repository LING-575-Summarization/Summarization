Greek radio and television stations reported that the air force pilots in the two fighter jets did not see any movement in the cockpit of the airliner before the crash and it was unclear if the two pilots were in their seats. The plane did not respond to radio calls One of the pilots appeared to have fallen ill or unconscious, according to reports. Live television broadcasts from the disaster area showed firefighting aircraft dousing the wreckage site with water as rescue workers and volunteers combed the region, collecting corpses.
