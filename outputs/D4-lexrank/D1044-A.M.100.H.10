The Food Standards Agency sparked an international food safety alert on Feb. 18 when it announced that a sauce contaminated with the dye had been used in hundreds of British foods and exported to several European and Caribbean countries and to North America.
 It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.
