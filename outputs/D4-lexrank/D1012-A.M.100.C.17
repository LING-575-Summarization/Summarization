Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
 The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit.
 Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.
 Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors.
