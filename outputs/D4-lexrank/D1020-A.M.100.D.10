To its credit, the Agriculture Department has announced recalls of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other companies in the last four months, most recently last weekend.
 However, USDA officials said they did not feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant.
 Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.
