The opposition leader has charged that the hardline regime of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the December 26 presidential re-vote pitting him against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. McClellan also denied anew that US money that went to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine ended up supporting the Western-leaning Yushchenko directly. "We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election," he said "The United States strongly supports a democratic process that reflects the will of the people of Ukraine."
