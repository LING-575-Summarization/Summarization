Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power. Separately yesterday, Armed Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Wahab Mokodongan said he was not adverse to an investigation by the Attorney General's office into corruption under Soeharto "ABRI is part of the government. And the authority to conduct the investigation is the Attorney General's office," he told reporters. "Yes, Soeharto will receive the team soon," Tanjung said.
