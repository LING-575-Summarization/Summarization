Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with other strains . For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts . And though symbiont D is widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not know whether all of them can support the strain.
 The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed . Another half are damaged but could be saved, it said.

It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
Lyle Vail, director of the Lizard Island Research Station on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, said damage to coral reefs from a tsunami would likely be similar to that from a cyclone.
