The concern over concussions, and whether headgear can protect against them, has become a growing issue for youth soccer associations.
 This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S. Soccer Federation, which contends that marketing to the fears of parents has trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing concussions.
 Many of these motorcyclist casualties could be avoided if there was widespread wearing of safety helmets.
 Players might develop a false sense of security, relying on headgear instead of proper medical evaluation after suffering a concussion, federation doctors say.
