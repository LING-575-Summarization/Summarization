Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may reflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a 1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested at least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more likely.
 The tremor--accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes--suggested that the magma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to suspect an eruption might be imminent.
 "All this buildup was leading to that relatively small eruption."
