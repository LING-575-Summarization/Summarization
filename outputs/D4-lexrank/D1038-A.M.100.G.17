A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
 Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
 The expectation is that magma--underground molten rock--will reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.
