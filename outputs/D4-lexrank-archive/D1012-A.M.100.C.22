Though the plane was out of radio contact with the ground for more than an hour after that, it appeared that at least some passengers remained conscious . Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit.
 Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilots flew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparently trying to take control of the Boeing 737 . It was unclear whether they were passengers or pilots.
