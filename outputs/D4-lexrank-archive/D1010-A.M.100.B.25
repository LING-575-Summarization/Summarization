Emory University Hospital has confirmed that a brain surgery patient does not have the human version of mad cow disease, but does have a rare, fatal disorder that resembles it.
 The hospital issued an alert more than a week ago saying preliminary tests on the unidentified patient produced a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . It warned that at least 500 other patients may have been exposed to the disease if they came into contact with surgical instruments used on the patient.
 The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
