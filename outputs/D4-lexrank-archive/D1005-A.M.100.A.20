WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--An international research team, led by scientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), has discovered a gene which, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease in some families . Although Parkinson's disease is usually not inherited, the discovery of this gene and further study of how it works could open up new avenues of research for preventing or delaying the onset of the disease.
 It has long been thought that the sticky protein triggers the death of brain cells.
