Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
 Hariri died at American University Hospital, while former Minister of Justice Samir al-Jisr and former Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fuleihan, who were traveling in Hariri's convoy, survived the blast.
 At least eight others were also killed, including some of Hariri's bodyguards.
 Security forces sealed off the scene, where a big crater was gouged by the explosion.
