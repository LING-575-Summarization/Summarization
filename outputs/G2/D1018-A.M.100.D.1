Holloway was on the last day of a five-day graduation trip with 124 classmates and seven adult chaperons from Mountain Brook High School in Birmingham to this Dutch Caribbean island.
Joran remains in police custody with two other young men in the May 30 disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18.
Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.
The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family first knew of them.
