China has informed Russia of the water pollution situation in the country's northeastern Songhua River, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said here on Thursday.
Liu said China was very concerned about possible hazards to Russia and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution.
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang.
An 80-kilometer chemical slick has been slowly moving downstream along the Songhua River and reached Harbin on Thursday morning.
