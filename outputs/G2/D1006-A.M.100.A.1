Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
Merck Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people who used it for longer than 18 months.
Officials of the Food and Drug Administration said Friday that a meeting about these issues will occur in January.
Even as Merck was deciding to withdraw the drug, there were medical experts arguing that it should not.
