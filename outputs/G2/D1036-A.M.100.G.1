But the doctors said that Yushchenko's facial disfigurement would remain for a long time as follow-up treatments continue.
Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
"We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election," he said.
